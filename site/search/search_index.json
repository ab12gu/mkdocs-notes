This increases reliability. - 60mA at full brightness (20mA per color channel). - P = V x I - 12v * 0.06A = 0.72 W per LED - 5v * 0.06A = 0.30 W per LED - 144 LEDs * 0.06 Amps = 8.64 amps per 1m - For 5V systems, if the voltage drop approaches 10% of the supply voltage (i.e., 0.5V), the LEDs will start to show dimming or malfunction - 18 AWG wire, which has a resistance of 0.00639 ohms per meter - Current per LED: - Red channel : Around 20mA . - Green channel : Around 20mA . - Blue channel : Around 20mA . - If the blue channel is not at full brightness , the current running through the blue LED will be less than 20mA . - This will depend on the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal controlling the brightness. - If you reduce the brightness of the blue channel to, say, 50%, then the current would drop to around 10mA for that channel. Voltage drop - The longer the wire and the higher the current, the more voltage is lost in the wire. The forward voltage depends on the material and color (wavelength) of the LED: Red LEDs : ~1.8\u20132.2V Green LEDs : ~2.0\u20133.5V Blue/White LEDs : ~3.0\u20133.6V Blue light typically falls in the range of 450\u2013495 nanometers The larger the bandgap, the higher the forward voltage The current coming out of the","title":"Input voltage"},{"location":"electronics/led-projects/led-strip-specs/","text":"Label Interpretation: - \"WS2811\" for LED strips, the \"WS\" stands for \"World Semi\" - First two digits (28) are the height and 2nd two (11) are width of LED in mm - \"SK6812\" might correlate to another company, unsure ![[ws2812b-strip.png]] LED technology types: - Chip-on-Board (COB) - smoother light because their chips are spread out evenly - usually just one color - up to three times more light - produce up to 40% more light per watt than SMD LED strip lights - multiple LED chips (typically nine or more) bonded directly to a substrate by the manufacturer to form a single module - cost more than SMD LED strip lights - 20-30% more expensive - typically have a higher voltage and amperage - typically controlled using a constant voltage (CV) controller - Surface Mount Device (SMD) - chips closer together, which can create uneven light distribution - more efficient than COB (more lumens per watt) - broader light beam; therefore, smaller heat sink - more expensive to produce - DMX is a digital lighting control protocol - widely used in the professional lighting industry - to control COB LED strip lights using DMX, you will need a DMX decoder. - A DMX decoder converts the DMX signal into readable format for leds - allows you to control the brightness, color, and other features of the lights. A CV controller maintains a constant voltage to the LED strip lights, regardless of the load. This is important because COB LED strip lights can draw a lot of current, and a CV controller will ensure that the lights do not overheat or damage. SMD LED strip lights, on the other hand, are typically controlled using a constant current (CC) controller. A CC controller maintains a constant current to the LED strip lights, regardless of the voltage. This is important because SMD LED strip lights are more sensitive to voltage fluctuations, and a CC controller will help to protect the lights from damage. SMD 5050 light output is 3 times that of SMD 3528 LEDs 3528 LEDs can be most cost effective as they are thinner than 5050 You can get more brightness on a strip by fitting more Newer ultrabright LEDs - 3020 & 3014 SMD LED Brightness determination - how many LED are on the strip - lumen output to determine brightness Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a measurement of how natural colors render under an artificial white light source when compared with sunlight. The index is measured from 0-100, with a perfect 100 indicating that colors of objects under the light source appear the same as they would under natural sunlight. CRIs under 80 are generally considered \u2018poor\u2019 while ranges over 90 are considered \u2018great\u2019.
