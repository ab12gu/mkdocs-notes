Tahini paste Tahini paste is made of toasted sesame seeds. I use Soom tahini made of 100% roasted and pressed organic Ethiopian White Humera sesame seeds offering a creamy texture and a nutty flavor. Garlic. 1 to 2 fresh garlic cloves, depending on how garlicy you enjoy your dips. Lemon juice . Citrus gives this eggplant dip a nice lift. You can make it as subtle or lemony as you like. Greek Yogurt (secret optional ingredient) If you\u2019re going for a vegan baba ganoush, omit the yogurt, but otherwise it is a great way to thicken the dip, making it even more creamy, while also enhancing the color turning it from a deep beige to something a little brighter and more appealing. Seasonings. Salt and pepper, of course. If you like, add a bit of Sumac and cayenne pepper for heat. Extra virgin olive oil. A drizzle of a rich and peppery extra virgin olive oil over this dip is the perfect way to finish it! Garnish. If you like, add toasted pine nuts and some chopped fresh parsley to serve.
