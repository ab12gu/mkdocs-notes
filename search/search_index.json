Chip-on-Board (COB)     - smoother light because their chips are spread out evenly     - usually just one color     - up to three times more light          - produce up to 40% more light per watt than SMD LED strip lights     - multiple LED chips (typically nine or more) bonded directly to a substrate by the manufacturer to form a single module     - cost more than SMD LED strip lights         - 20-30% more expensive     - typically have a higher voltage and amperage     - typically controlled using a constant voltage (CV) controller - Surface Mount Device (SMD)     - chips closer together, which can create uneven light distribution     - more efficient than COB (more lumens per watt)     - broader light beam; therefore, smaller heat sink     - more expensive to produce     - </p> <p>DMX is a digital lighting control protocol  - widely used in the professional lighting industry - to control COB LED strip lights using DMX, you will need a DMX decoder.      - A DMX decoder converts the DMX signal into readable format for leds     - allows you to control the brightness, color, and other features of the lights.</p> <p>A CV controller maintains a constant voltage to the LED strip lights, regardless of the load. This is important because COB LED strip lights can draw a lot of current, and a CV controller will ensure that the lights do not overheat or damage.</p> <p>SMD LED strip lights, on the other hand, are typically controlled using a constant current (CC) controller. A CC controller maintains a constant current to the LED strip lights, regardless of the voltage. This is important because SMD LED strip lights are more sensitive to voltage fluctuations, and a CC controller will help to protect the lights from damage.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>SMD 5050 light output is 3 times that of SMD 3528 LEDs</li> <li>3528 LEDs can be most cost effective as they are thinner than 5050</li> <li>You can get more brightness on a strip by fitting more</li> </ul> <p>Newer ultrabright LEDs - 3020 &amp; 3014 SMD LED</p> <p>Brightness determination - how many LED are on the strip  - lumen output to determine brightness</p> <p>Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a measurement of how natural colors render under an artificial white light source when compared with sunlight. The index is measured from 0-100, with a perfect 100 indicating that colors of objects under the light source appear the same as they would under natural sunlight. CRIs under 80 are generally considered \u2018poor\u2019 while ranges over 90 are considered \u2018great\u2019.</p> <ul> <li>Accent Lighting and Mood Lighting - 100 to 350 lumens per foot</li> <li>Under cabinet Lighting - 175 to 525 lumens per foot</li> <li>Task Lighting with low distance from light source - 280 to 437 lumens per foot</li> <li>Task Lighting with higher distance from light source - 500 to 1000 lumens per foot</li> <li>Indirect lighting in a bedroom/ hotel / vehicle / lobby - 375 to 562 lumens per foot</li> <li>Industrial lighting / signage / tube replacements - 500 to 950 lumens per foot</li> </ul> <p>CCT (Correlated Color Temperature) refers to the color temperature of light, measured in degrees Kelvin (K).
