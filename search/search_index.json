Chip-on-Board (COB)     - smoother light because their chips are spread out evenly     - usually just one color     - up to three times more light          - produce up to 40% more light per watt than SMD LED strip lights     - multiple LED chips (typically nine or more) bonded directly to a substrate by the manufacturer to form a single module     - cost more than SMD LED strip lights         - 20-30% more expensive     - typically have a higher voltage and amperage     - typically controlled using a constant voltage (CV) controller - Surface Mount Device (SMD)     - chips closer together, which can create uneven light distribution     - more efficient than COB (more lumens per watt)     - broader light beam; therefore, smaller heat sink     - more expensive to produce     - </p> <p>DMX is a digital lighting control protocol  - widely used in the professional lighting industry - to control COB LED strip lights using DMX, you will need a DMX decoder.      - A DMX decoder converts the DMX signal into readable format for leds     - allows you to control the brightness, color, and other features of the lights.</p> <p>A CV controller maintains a constant voltage to the LED strip lights, regardless of the load. This is important because COB LED strip lights can draw a lot of current, and a CV controller will ensure that the lights do not overheat or damage.</p> <p>SMD LED strip lights, on the other hand, are typically controlled using a constant current (CC) controller. A CC controller maintains a constant current to the LED strip lights, regardless of the voltage. This is important because SMD LED strip lights are more sensitive to voltage fluctuations, and a CC controller will help to protect the lights from damage.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>SMD 5050 light output is 3 times that of SMD 3528 LEDs</li> <li>3528 LEDs can be most cost effective as they are thinner than 5050</li> <li>You can get more brightness on a strip by fitting more</li> </ul> <p>Newer ultrabright LEDs - 3020 &amp; 3014 SMD LED</p> <p>Brightness determination - how many LED are on the strip  - lumen output to determine brightness</p> <p>Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a measurement of how natural colors render under an artificial white light source when compared with sunlight.
