## Depreciated

--- 

#### Reason for starting:

- Bob (friend) talked about another repo porting over to mkdocs and wanted me to explain what they doing.
- I explained it and thought it was a great idea so thought I might use it for my own notes/blogs that have been on hiatus.

--- 

#### Reason for depreciating:

- However, I didn't realize that the static site generator I use (jekyll) was just a more common/powerful version of it.
- So I set it up via their documentation, but won't be used.

--- 

#### Future:

- Using gitsubmodules for blogs
- Hosting them on personal website via Jekyll framework ( [abgup.com](abgup.com) )
- Using medium.com api to push to medium after post
