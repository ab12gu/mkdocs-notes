# Medium vs. Substack

“Substack doesn't really offer avenues for you to grow an audience natively, the only people who see your stuff are the ones subscribed to you, since it was designed like email newsletters. Medium is organized more socially and by topic, where somebody could conceivably stumble upon your piece and become a fan/follower. There's no mechanism for that on substack. “

- "For $5 per month on Medium, you have access to all authors and articles"
- "On Substack, for $5 per month, you get access just to one author”

Better choice to use `Medium.com`
