# Router

Device that forwards data packets between computer networks.

Routers can be built from standard computer parts but are mostly specialized purpose-built computers.

- Early routers used software-based forwarding, running on a CPU. 
- More sophisticated devices use application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to increase performance or add advanced filtering and firewall functionality.
