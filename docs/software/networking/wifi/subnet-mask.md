# Subnet Mask

Divides the network into 2 more more divisons. 

- An IP address is a 32-bit number usually like: `192.168.1.2`

The most common subnet mask for small home networks:

```
255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```

- The 1's are the network portion 
    - first 32 bits
- The 0's are the host portion 
    - last 8 bits
    - identifies the device on the network
