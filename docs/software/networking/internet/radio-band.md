# Radio Band

Wifi is a family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards.

Wi-Fi most commonly uses:

- 2.4 GHz (120 mm) UHF 
    - Microwave heating uses 2.45 band, which causes interference
    - Bluetooth is another networking technology using the 2.4 GHz band
- 5 GHz (60 mm) SHF radio bands
- 6 GHz SHF band used in newer generations of the standard

These bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks, but can only transmit on a channel at a time.

Virtually all laptops, tablet computers, computer printers and cellphones now have 802.11 wireless modems using the 2.4 and 5.7 GHz ISM bands

Near-field communication (NFC) devices such as proximity cards and contactless smart cards use the lower-frequency 13 and 27 MHz ISM bands.


- IEEE 802.11/Wi-Fi 2450 MHz and 5800 MHz bands
- Bluetooth 2450 MHz band falls under WPAN

## Government Regulation

ISM radio bands are portions of the radio spectrum reserved internationally for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) purposes 

- Governed by the FCC (Federal Communcations Commition).

However, it made it's way to be approved for many low power communcation devices: 

- Cordless phones
- Bluetooth devices
- Near-field communication (NFC) devices
- Garage door openers
- Baby monitors
- Wireless computer networks (Wi-Fi)

Outside this band, they would require a government license.

## Speed 

As of 2019
- can run at 9.6 Gbit/s

## Obstructions

Common obstructions:

- walls
- pillars
- home appliances
