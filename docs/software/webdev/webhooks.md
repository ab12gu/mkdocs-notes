# Webhooks

Webhooks let you subscribe to events with callbacks

- user-defined HTTP callbacks
- triggered by some event, such as pushing code to a repository
- the client makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook
- the server reacts to request 
- simple integration to web interfaces because data is sent via http
