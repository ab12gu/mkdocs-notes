# MkDocs

## Material for MKDocs

### Video

Seems there is no support [https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/3984](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/3984)... And since the developers for material are working on a new SSG, probably won't be implemented.

But inline html works:

```html
<video autoplay width="320" height="240" controls playsinline loop>
  <source src="../images/kiran-shedding.mp4"/>
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```:q

### Inline Styles

```css
![alt text](image-location){: style="width: 50% background-color: white;"}
```
