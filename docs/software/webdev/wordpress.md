# Wordpress

Half of all websites use wordpress!

It is a blog based website, allowing users to simply add normal text and render it on a webpage.

There is `wordpress.com` and `wordpress.org`. 

- [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)
    - commerical product that allows people to host their website through wordpress servers
    - [Plans](https://wordpress.com/setup/onboarding/plans?)
        - free tier has google ads
        - personal ($4 per month) removes ads + themes
        - professional ($8 per month) allows video upload + google analytics/stats
- [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org)
    - you have to either host your own servers
    - or be able to connect it to free/paid online server

Generally a good idea to start with free version of `wordpress.com` and then decide if you want to pay or host your own.
