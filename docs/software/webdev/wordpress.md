# Wordpress

A quarter of the top websites use wordpress! (and half of total websites)

It website builder with easy-to-use templates, allowing users to simply add normal text and render it on a webpage. Forked from a `b2/cafelog` as it became less active by Matt Mullenweg to implment new features in 2003.



There is `wordpress.com` and `wordpress.org`. 

- [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)
    - commerical product that allows people to host their website through wordpress servers
    - [Plans](https://wordpress.com/setup/onboarding/plans?)
        - free tier has google ads
        - personal ($4 per month) removes ads + themes
        - professional ($8 per month) allows video upload + google analytics/stats
- [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org)
    - you have to either host your own servers
    - or be able to connect it to free/paid online server

Generally a good idea to start with free version of `wordpress.com` and then decide if you want to pay or host your own.

However, `wordpress.org` recommends some [alternate hosting sites](https://wordpress.org/hosting/) for development due to donations back to development. Also, mentions wordpress.com but only for their free tier... hmmm

## Controversy

Matt Mullenweg, CEO of wordpress, like any CEO tbh, has a bunch of public facing issues. The main one is by trying to exclude companies that don't pay back royalities... Do you really need more money?

He also owns `tumblr` so some issues in not sensoring harassment there...
