# Bash

**Bash** (Bourne-Again shell) is a scripting language for unix operating systems, developed in 1989. It is run as a modern version of the bourne shell `/bin/sh/`, developed in 1976.

Needs to start file with a `shebang` which is a sharp + hashtag (!#)

```bash
$ !# /bin/env bash
$ !# /bin/sh
```

Then if the script is run as a stand-alone program in cmdline, you must give it execuable permissions

```bash
$ chmod +x .example.sh
```
