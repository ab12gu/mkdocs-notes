# Hardware Hacking

We are passionate about raising awareness on security and privacy issues, and we believe the best way to do that is by training as many proper hackers as possible, who can then go out and find new issues on their own.

At our workshops, we will focus on a specific topic in the field of security and offer practical hands-on training combined with a digestible quantity of foundational background information. We will adjust the discussion on any given day to the skill level of the participants.
