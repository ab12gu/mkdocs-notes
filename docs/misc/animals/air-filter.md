# Air Filter

Tim from carshop made an air filter to filter the poop smell of his cat. He doesn't have the cat anymore so I have the filter now. 

Uses desposable furnace filter

- look for odor reducing
- he goes for arm and hammer 
- may find at home depot, but he buys online only, 6 pack
- good for like a month

I probably want to redesign it to not take up as much space and have a dresser roller mechanism to be able to move out litter and maybe a cloth door.
