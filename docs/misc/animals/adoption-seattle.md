# Adoption Seattle

Where I got my cat:

- [seattle.gov/fees](https://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/find-an-animal/adopt/adoption-fees-and-applications)
- [seattle.gov/adopt](https://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/find-an-animal/adopt)
- Cost: $30 -> $200
- Extra: $30 fee to register in Seattle (each year) 
    - charge you extra when you adopt
    - can get around if live outside


I got my dog from Burien C.A.R.E.S., but prices are 4x as much :(
