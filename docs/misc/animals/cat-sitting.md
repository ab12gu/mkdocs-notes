# Cat Sitting

- Name: Kajal (American name: Bean)
- Born: May 22nd, 2025
- Breed: Domestic Short Hair Black Cat

## Play

- Kiran and Kajal play all the time, no need to worry about them hurting one another
- Kiran may bark a little, but its all fun
- You can pet the cat, she will purr
    - Try not to let her bit too hard, but she does a playful bite when you rub her belly
    - Generally she bites my toes too hard when i move them around too much in bed
- Don't worry about knives or sharp objects, kajal is quick and smart to not get hurt

## Hiding

- When I stop paying attention, Kajal likes just being in tight places
    - like under the bed or couch
- So you might think she has run away, but she is probably just in those areas
- Call her name and make some noise to get her to come out
    - I call kajal and kiran comes by
    - Kiran knows you are saying kajal but she just wants the attention too..
- I sometimes open and close cabinets/closets
    - she will sneak into these immediately when you open them
    - just try to get her out before you close them
    - I often leave her in the closet for hours and she is fine (by accident)

## Litter

- Often you need clean the litter box daily
    - but kajal doesn't care and you can do it whenever
- I just use cheapest clay/sand litter
- She will know where the litter is when you put sand in it
- She rarely ever throws up (twice in 4 months)
- And she has never not pooped or peed outside the litterbox

## Food

- I use Iams Chicken Kitten food - [purple bag](https://www.amazon.com/Iams-Proactive-Health-Healthy-Chicken/dp/B01BMBYKUQ?)
    - available at petco and qfc
- I leave unlimited cat food
- Kiran will not eat the cat food, so you can have both on the ground

## Water/Wet food

- I know that it is recommended for cats to have wet food...
    - but kajal drinks enough water cause she drinks when kiran eats food
- She will drink out of kiran's water bowl, so no need for separate bowls of water
- Leave water out at all times

## Outside

- I take her out to events if all doors are closed
- And take her outside with a harness and leash
    - but don't walk her, just the harness and leash on if sitting in grass together
- but you don't need to do any of this

## Tricks and Commands

- She is a loud purrer
- When she does her Meow, usually means she is in distress
    - might be because she is being held and wants to get down generally
- She kinda knows her name Kajal    
    - try to call her with her name kajal to get her to know it
- 

## Nail Cutting

- I cut her nails a few times when I first got her
- But i rarely do
- If the nailcutter is in the bag, feel free to try to cut her nails
    - she might try to escape when you do but doesn't take that long and can do 1 at a time
- she generally only takes out her nails when she is on your shoulder and gets scared
- otherwise will not take out her nails when you pick her up

## Scratching

- She likes climbing
- She esecially likes climbing the windows screens over glass
    - I let her do this, she has never ripped my window screens so why not?
- I have a couple cardboard scratch pads, hopefully i brought you one!

## Sleep

- She sleeps near my legs on my bed with me
