# Cat Sitting

- Name: Kajal (American name: Bean)
- Born: May 22nd, 2025
- Breed: Domestic Short Hair Black Cat

## Litter

- Often you need clean the litter box daily
    - but kajal doesn't care and you can do it whenever
- I just use cheapest clay/sand litter

## Food

- I use Iams Chicken Kitten food - [purple bag](https://www.amazon.com/Iams-Proactive-Health-Healthy-Chicken/dp/B01BMBYKUQ?)
    - available at petco and qfc
- I leave unlimited cat food
- Kiran will not eat the cat food, so you can have both on the ground

## Water/Wet food

- I know that it is recommended for cats to have wet food...
    - but kajal drinks enough water cause she drinks when kiran eats food
- She will drink out of kiran's water bowl, so no need for separate bowls of water
- Leave water out at all times

## Outside

- I take her out to events if all doors are closed
- And take her outside with a harness and leash
    - but don't walk her, just the harness and leash on if sitting in grass together
- but you don't need to do any of this
