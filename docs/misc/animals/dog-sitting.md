# Dog Sitting

- Dog Name: Kiran
- Born: Sept 21st, 2020
- Race: Siberian Husky Mix (Unknown mix)
- Weight: 56 lbs


## Food

- [Iams Lamb](https://www.amazon.com/Iams-Proactive-Health-Adult-Food/dp/B07BCRTZ71?)
- [Kirkland Lamb](https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/products/33073-kirkland-signature-lamb-rice-and-vegetable-dog-food-40-lb)
- Unlimited, just leave food out in house
- Only needs to eat once a day
    - So if I am outside with her I just feed her at home

## Water

- Unlimited water
- Doesn't need water during walks but after

## Treats

- I don't give Kiran treats, but everyone I know does
    - I believe she will only like me because of treats and not me
- Feel free to buy treats, I will reimburse
- Kiran is a little picky on treats, so find what she likes

## Human Food

- She is Indian, so she likes rice
- She also likes bread
- She likes cooked meat (spice bad for dogs, so no spice)
- Cooked eggs
- Loves bread

## Dog Walking

- Walk at least once a day
- Preferably twice
- The longer she walks, the more she will poop
    - I think her body digests the food more while walking?

## Skin Picking

- Kiran picks her butt
    - it never gets to the place of bleeding so not an issue
    - not a nervous pick, just a grooming habit but gets caught up in picking it 
    - i generally tell her to stop, but she will do it when i'm not looking so it doesn't matter

## Humping

- She will hump my pillow when I leave my room
- Not an issue but... really kiran?
