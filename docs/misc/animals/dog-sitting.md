# Dog Sitting

- Dog Name: Kiran
- Born: Sept 21st, 2020
- Race: Siberian Husky Mix (Unknown mix)
- Weight: 56 lbs
- Gender: Femaie
- Spayed, so no kids :(
- No medications
- No pet insurance, overpriced/unnecessary
- Flea cream on neck monthly
    - I am very bad at doing this, but she isn't in nature much so don't use it that often

- Doesn't have a goto vet
- I have a couple petco free vet vouchers that you can use
    - if not in bag, i can send you a picture and help you book appointment
- Emergency Contact: Kristie: (817) 673-9529, lives in beacon hill

## Commands

- She doesn't like her paws being touched
    - so unable to do shake
- When saying a command, i say `Kiran` first to get her attention
    - like i say `Kiran sit` to tell her to sit
- She knows `sit` and `down` (meaning lay down)
- She knows `left/right` when i walk/run with her
- I say `let go/drop` when we play tug of war
- Say `Up` or `Jump` to get onto a couch/bed/booth at bar
    - You also double tap the location with your hand
- She is very quiet, so don't think this is abnormal 

## Behaviors

- If she is indoors and you are walking, she will sit really fast if she really needs to poop
    - very rare, but means she wants to poop now and you should go outside
- If she does her beg, i'll link it, means she is upset and wants something
    - water/food/outide
    - generally doesn't pout for pets, but sometimes she does
- she will want to be petted 24/7, up to u to engage
- I walk her with a waste strap now
    - she pulls more than she used to because of the strap but allows me to text and walk lol
    - my pelvis bones are actually get sore from walking/running with kiran and the hip strap, so just a heads up
        - might be good for bone growth? prevention of osteoperosis?
- She rarely has ever pooped or peed in the house, so really no worries there
- Be careful with other dogs/dogparkrs
    - She gets along with about 3/4ths of dogs
    - I am really good at being aware but just keep an eye out
    - She makes a growl with her nose so you know immediately if she doesn't like a dog
    - if that happens i try to keep those dogs away from each other
- She is picky about which dogs she likes
    - female dogs her size she generally doesn't like
    - loves smaller dogs, such as corgies
- She pushes dogs that don't move/play with her
    - not a sign of aggression, a sign of why are you so lazy?
    - a lot of bigger dogs don't play because they are slow and lazy so she pushes them

## Pets/Scratches

- She loves getting scratched right between her eyes and forhead
- then her neck
- then the top and sides of her butt
- she will lie on her back and you can pet her belly

## Play

- I don't play with her too much at home, because I have work to do
- But she will bring you toys to play fetch in the house and tug of war
    - some toys may lead to bloody gums, don't worry its normal
    - I would just stop tug of war if bloody, goes away in a minute
- I rarely do this anymore, but she does like dog videos on youtube/tv lol
- she has never bit any human so don't worry if she gets a little mouthy with you

## Grooming

- Kiran is also just like a cat
    - in that she will groom herself clean
- I don't wash or groom her
- but if you wanted to take her to a groomer lmk; i would be down to cover it!


## Shedding

- Sheds the entire month of April and September
- Outisde of these months, she doesn't lose much hair
- But during these months, even if you brush every day, the hair will stil come out in clumps at home
- No solution until after season
- Hopefully I gave you a brush :)
- At the start of shedding season, she eats a lot of fur during grooming
    - and becomes super gassy
    - so i don't let her sleep in my room, cause it smells bad

## Sleep

- She will sleep anywhere
- Couch, bed, carpet, hardwood
- Let her know whats a good place you would want her to sleep by tapping/showing her
    - but she might just choose to sleep on hardwood of colder, for example

## Poop/Poop bags

- All the dog parks have poop bags
    - i use these to restock
- But if you buy some, just venmo request me to restock!
- Twice, Kiran has gone through a bloody poop phase
    - generally happens for a week and goes away
    - unsure cause but no need to worry, goes away by itself
- I tie the poop bags to the leash and untie during walk (any method works)

## Food

- [Iams Lamb](https://www.amazon.com/Iams-Proactive-Health-Adult-Food/dp/B07BCRTZ71?)
- [Kirkland Lamb](https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/products/33073-kirkland-signature-lamb-rice-and-vegetable-dog-food-40-lb)
- Unlimited, just leave food out in house
- Only needs to eat once a day
    - So if I am outside with her I just feed her at home
- Kiran has a strong stomache, so anydogfood really works
- I do not give her wet food, unnecessary tbh
- She really likes finding/eating the food scraps on the ground :(
- She will eat goose poop (only goose poop)
    - avoid walking or letting her eat geese poop
    - a lot of geese poop at lake union waterfront in SLU
- if you leave your food on counter unattended, Kiran might eat it.

## Hikes

- I put her off leash on hikes
- Great recall, never runs too far away
- technically she should be on leash based on state laws, but who gives a fuck?
- she will run in front/behind and into the trees, but always comes back

## Water

- Unlimited water
- Doesn't need water during walks but after

## Treats

- I don't give Kiran treats, but everyone I know does
    - I believe she will only like me because of treats and not me
- Feel free to buy treats, I will reimburse
- Kiran is a little picky on treats, so find what she likes

## Human Food

- She is Indian, so she likes rice
- She also likes bread
- She likes cooked meat (spice bad for dogs, so no spice)
- Cooked eggs
- Loves bread

## Dog Walking

- Walk at least once a day
- Preferably twice
- The longer she walks, the more she will poop
    - I think her body digests the food more while walking?

## Skin Picking

- Kiran picks her butt
    - it never gets to the place of bleeding so not an issue
    - not a nervous pick, just a grooming habit but gets caught up in picking it 
    - i generally tell her to stop, but she will do it when i'm not looking so it doesn't matter

## Humping

- She will hump my pillow when I leave my room
- Not an issue but... really kiran?
