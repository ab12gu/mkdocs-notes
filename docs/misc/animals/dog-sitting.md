# Dog Sitting

- Dog Name: Kiran
- Born: Sept 21st, 2020
- Race: Siberian Husky Mix (Unknown mix)
- Weight: 56 lbs
- Gender: Femaie
- Spayed, so no kids :(
- No medications
- No pet insurance, overpriced/unnecessary

## Emergency/Vet

- Doesn't have a goto vet
- I have a couple petco free vet vouchers that you can use
    - if not in bag, i can send you a picture and help you book appointment
- Emergency Contact: Kristie: (817) 673-9529, lives in beacon hill

## Play

- I don't play with her too much at home, because I have work to do
- But she will bring you toys to play fetch in the house and tug of war
    - some toys may lead to bloody gums, don't worry its normal
    - I would just stop tug of war if bloody, goes away in a minute
- I rarely do this anymore, but she does like dog videos on youtube/tv lol

## Grooming

- Kiran is also just like a cat
    - in that she will groom herself clean
- I don't wash or groom her
- but if you wanted to take her to a groomer lmk; i would be down to cover it!


## Shedding

- Sheds the entire month of April and September
- Outisde of these months, she doesn't lose much hair
- But during these months, even if you brush every day, the hair will stil come out in clumps at home
- No solution until after season
- Hopefully I gave you a brush :)
- At the start of shedding season, she eats a lot of fur during grooming
    - and becomes super gassy
    - so i don't let her sleep in my room, cause it smells bad

## Sleep

- She will sleep anywhere
- Couch, bed, carpet, hardwood
- Let her know whats a good place you would want her to sleep by tapping/showing her
    - but she might just choose to sleep on hardwood of colder, for example

## Poop/Poop bags

- All the dog parks have poop bags
    - i use these to restock
- But if you buy some, just venmo request me to restock!
- Twice, Kiran has gone through a bloody poop phase
    - generally happens for a week and goes away
    - unsure cause but no need to worry, goes away by itself

## Food

- [Iams Lamb](https://www.amazon.com/Iams-Proactive-Health-Adult-Food/dp/B07BCRTZ71?)
- [Kirkland Lamb](https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/products/33073-kirkland-signature-lamb-rice-and-vegetable-dog-food-40-lb)
- Unlimited, just leave food out in house
- Only needs to eat once a day
    - So if I am outside with her I just feed her at home
- Kiran has a strong stomache, so anydogfood really works
- I do not give her wet food, unnecessary tbh
- She really likes finding/eating the food scraps on the ground :(
- She will eat goose poop (only goose poop)
    - avoid walking or letting her eat geese poop
    - a lot of geese poop at lake union waterfront in SLU
- if you leave your food on counter unattended, Kiran might eat it.

## Hikes

- I put her off leash on hikes
- Great recall, never runs too far away
- technically she should be on leash based on state laws, but who gives a fuck?
- she will run in front/behind and into the trees, but always comes back

## Water

- Unlimited water
- Doesn't need water during walks but after

## Treats

- I don't give Kiran treats, but everyone I know does
    - I believe she will only like me because of treats and not me
- Feel free to buy treats, I will reimburse
- Kiran is a little picky on treats, so find what she likes

## Human Food

- She is Indian, so she likes rice
- She also likes bread
- She likes cooked meat (spice bad for dogs, so no spice)
- Cooked eggs
- Loves bread

## Dog Walking

- Walk at least once a day
- Preferably twice
- The longer she walks, the more she will poop
    - I think her body digests the food more while walking?

## Skin Picking

- Kiran picks her butt
    - it never gets to the place of bleeding so not an issue
    - not a nervous pick, just a grooming habit but gets caught up in picking it 
    - i generally tell her to stop, but she will do it when i'm not looking so it doesn't matter

## Humping

- She will hump my pillow when I leave my room
- Not an issue but... really kiran?
