# Credit Cards

As of Jan 2026, the credit card rewards max out at flat rates of 2%. You can get variable rates from 1 to 6% based on category, but you would need to mentally track. 

A good idea to start with 2% card and increase cards gradually to get better rewards. 

## Late Fees

Current issue with credit cards is the late fees are very high. Therefore, you should always autopay it with your debit/savings/or/checking accounts. 

You can ask to remove a 1 time late fee per year at most banks. 

## Recommended Credit Cards

Note: Mastercard sometimes is not accepted, so should have a VISA backup

## New Card Bonus

Most credit cards give you bonuses from $100 to $1000 when you create a new card. 

- You need to spend a certain amount in the few first months to receive rewards 
- E.g. $1000 in first 3 months to get back $300

If buying multiple cards, get the bonus for one, and apply for another after bonus is recieved. 

## Credit Card Limit

You can only open 5 credit cards within 24 months (5/24 Rule). Will be denied if exceeds.

## Fees

Some credit cards have a yearly fee. These allow you to get higher percent back or freebies.
