## Notes by Matthew Gunnarson

Camps usually have a max party size of either 6 or 12

So a coastal hike has a couple things that you need to look into.

1. Most of the hikeable coast is in the Olympic National Park so you usually need:
    - a backcountry permit for anywhere you plan on camping. 
    - some places are booked up, some are not. 
2. Usually you need to bring a bear canister. 
    - some ranger stations will lend them out but you have to find which ones and when they're open. 
    - Or, people can just buy their own if they don't have one already. 
3. Some sections of the trail are only crossable at a low enough tide 
    - check tide charts to see when/if they're crossable.

Interior section of the park where you really only need to worry about getting the Backcountry permits. 

- I think usually in that part of the park bear hangs are permitted and you don't need to deal with a canister.
