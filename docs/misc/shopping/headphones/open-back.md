# Open Back

Closed headphones causes a constant pressure due to no method of sound escaping. Active noise cancelling (ANC) causes more pressure. The reduced airflow causes moisture buildup in ear. Earwax gets trapped deeper instead of naturally removing. However the pressure will not cause hearing loss :).

Back of the earcups open

- leaks more sound out
- lets more ambient sounds into the headphone
