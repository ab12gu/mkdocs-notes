Things to look for:
=======
## Layers

- Top: Pillow (optional)
    - Materials: 
        - Wool/Cotton**
            - Good in keeping mattress cool
        - Quilted latex topper
        - Thin pillow-top foam
    - Thickness: 1"
- Middle-top: Comfort
    - Materials:
        - softer latex
        - gel infused memory foam
            - cooler than memory foam/molds to body
        - HDP foam (soft)
            - fast compression, cheaper
    - Thickness:  2-4"
- Middle: transition layer (optional)
    - Materials: Latex/Foam 
        - Latex is more resilient than foam; lasting 10+ years**
        - Talalay or Dunlop natural latex (medium-firm)
        - Slightly firmer than memory/adaptive foam
    - Thickness: 1-2"
- Suppport Base
    - Foam block, pocket coils**, latex block
        - Foam is cheaper & less breathable than coils

        - 5–6″ for lighter sleepers
- Mattress encasement zipped together
