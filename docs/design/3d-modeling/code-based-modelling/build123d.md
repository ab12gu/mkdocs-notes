# build123d

Python based boundary representation (BREP) modelling framework for 2d/3d modelling.

- Built on the Open Cascade geometric kernel
- Generated from faults of CADQuery
    - Somewhat restricted Fluent API (method chaining)
    - Replaced with full python toolbox

## Rendering

Use [OCP CAD Viewer](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer)

- OCP = OCCT-powered (referring to the underlying Open CASCADE Technology).

How to run: 

1. via vscode extension
2. via terminal:

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ python -m ocp_vscode
$ python -m ocp_vscode --theme dark
$ python box_generate.py # need a 2nd terminal or tmux
```

This will start a Flask server and the viewer can be reached under

```
http://127.0.0.1/<port-number>/viewer
```

## Coding Structure

By default, there is no [units](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_part.html#units).
When exporting to external formats like STL or STEP the units are assumed to be millimeters (mm).

There are two types of way to design, build mode & algebra mode. 

### Build Mode

```python
with BuildPart() as my_part:
    ...
    with BuildSketch() as my_sketch:
        ...
        with BuildLine() as my_line:
            ...
        ...
    ...

```


Code breakdown:

- **BuildPart:** builds volume
- **BuildSketch:** creates area
- **BuildLine:** creates lines

### Algebra Mode

## Animations

[https://github.com/GarryBGoode/gggears](https://github.com/GarryBGoode/gggears "https://github.com/GarryBGoode/gggears")

- [https://github.com/bernhard-42/bd_animation/tree/main](https://github.com/bernhard-42/bd_animation/tree/main)
    - Seems Animation it should be included in ocp_vscode

You can see the animation in the viewer w/ this code:
```python
import numpy as np

animation = Animation(p.part)
times = np.linspace(0, 2, 11) # 2 seconds split in 0.2 intervals
values = np.linspace(0, 360, 11) # as many positions as times
animation.add_track(f"/Group", "rz", times, values) # animate the group 

show(p)
animation.animate(1)
```


I never toyed with that feature myself, but [YACV](https://yeicor-3d.github.io/yet-another-cad-viewer/?preload=logo.glb&preload=logo_hl.glb&preload=logo_hl_tex.glb&preload=fox.glb&preload=img.glb&preload=location.glb) internally uses the [GLTF format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/"GLTF), which is a common one supporting animations. The documentation for YACV is nearly non-existant, but I guess, it relies on model-viewer for this feature, so maybe [_their_ documentation](https://modelviewer.dev/examples/animation/index.html) may help.

## Mobile Sandbox

There are wasm ports that work on mobile

- [https://jojain.github.io/build123d-sandbox/](https://jojain.github.io/build123d-sandbox/) (works great on android and apparently works ok on newer iphones)
