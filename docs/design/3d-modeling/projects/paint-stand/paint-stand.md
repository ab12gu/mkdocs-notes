# Paint Stand

## Project Description

Elizabeth wanted to remake her paint stand to something more sturdy. So I 3d modelled and printed it. 

## Materials

## CAD Software

I made an initial design with `Fusion360`, but noticed that I cannot save my designs locally so I look again to alternative sources. 

Currently, designing in code based modelling via python/`build123d`.
