# 2D Modelling

I tried libreCAD of these softwares for a little while, but they are pretty old and features are limited. Might be good if you use it regularly... 

It was particullarly hard to get a colorscheme + font size (too small) to all work well

- [LibreCAD](https://librecad.org/)
- [QCAD](https://www.qcad.org/en/)

Light Theme for LibreCAD:

- [github/stylesheet](https://github.com/LibreCAD/Resources/blob/master/style_sheets/fusion/r-a-v-a-s/alpha.qss)
- Options -> Widget Options -> 'Select' Style Sheets
- Select .qss file downloaded from github
- Assign to windows


Uninstall Plugins to use community version of QCAD

- Else times out every 15min
- Click remove on homescreen for trial version to activate
- Plugin removal location -> application -> "right click" show package contents
