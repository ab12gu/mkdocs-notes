# 3D Modelling

I am using [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) and [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/)

Previously, I've used `SolidWorks, NX, Fusion360, Abaqus, Ansys, and FreeCAD`. But you can't really actively use everything and I tend to use things based on availability and feature availability. I can get to the same result using any software, just not in the same amount of time!

## Future Me!

- Need to try: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- Need to see if can sell CAD models
- Need to try texture printing: [https://www.romanreiner.com/creating-textures-for-3d-printing/](https://www.romanreiner.com/creating-textures-for-3d-printing/)
