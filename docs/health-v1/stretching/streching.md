# Stretching


## Andrew Huberman recommendations

Static Stretching Protocol:
 
- Warm up before stretching for better effectiveness
- Hold each stretch for 30 seconds
    - Aim for 5 minutes of static stretching per muscle group per week.
    - 2-4 sets of 30-second holds
    - Spread over 5-6 days a week
    - Stretches can be extended to 60 seconds if fewer days per week
