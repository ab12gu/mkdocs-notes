# Hearing Loss

Causes for hearing Loss:

- High Volume (Sound Pressure Level / Decibels)
    - 85 dB+ for long periods = risky
        - (e.g., loud traffic, hair dryers, busy restaurants)
    - 100+ dB for short bursts = damaging
        - (e.g., concerts, clubs, power tools, headphones at max)

- If they’re forced to vibrate too hard or too often, they bend, break, and die — permanently

- Duration of Exposure

| Volume | Safe Listening Time |
|--------|----------------------|
| 85 dB  | ~8 hours             |
| 95 dB  | ~1 hour              |
| 105 dB | ~5 minutes           |

- Headphones
    - No air to diffuse the pressure, so inner ear takes the full hit
    - People often turn them up to overcome noise, increasing risk

- Acoustic trauma: Explosions, gunshots, firecrackers (>120–140 dB)



The inner ear hair cells (in the cochlea) vibrate to detect sound

- Tinnitus (ringing) can be an early sign of damage.
- Poor recovery time between exposures increases risk.

Risk Mitigation

Use speakers when possible

Avoid Cotton Swabs

- Don't push wax in; it can damage your eardrum or canal.
 
Let Ears Recover

- After loud exposure, give your ears 12-24 hours of quiet.

Use vented or high-fidelity earplugs (like Loop, Etymotic, or Alpine) — they reduce harmful sound without totally muting your environment.
