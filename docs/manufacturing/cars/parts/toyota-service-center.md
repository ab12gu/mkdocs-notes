When looking for an ABS component module for my Toyota Prius 08, I got various quotes to show how much a branch upsells for just part no labor. Component Number: 44500-47140

- $3000 Sodo Seattle
- $2195 Kirkland 
- $2002 Renton 
- $1920 Bellevue (MSRP)
- $1920 Swickard (MSRP)
- $1913 Lake City 

This helps show which branches you should avoid buying parts from :).
