# Mold

## How to Prevent

Mold forms from moisture and stagnant air

- therefore, if windows closed, the mold will generate in closed left cars
    - 1/4"->1/2" window gap
- tiny airflow (parted windows) will prevent mold


### Remove moisture from air

A/C removes moisture from air and dumps it under the car

DampRid (chemically)

- [home depot bag, 8oz bag, $3](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DampRid-8-1-oz-Fresh-Scent-Single-Use-Bag-Moisture-Absorber-Pack-of-1-FG20FS/332504240?)
- [home depot refill, $5](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DampRid-44-oz-Lavender-Vanilla-Moisture-Absorber-Refill-FG30LVSB/318946076?)
- Lasts about 1 month
- 10–15 oz container
- Silica gel packs work the same but are more expensive/smaller formfactor (food pouches)

A `dehumidifier` would work but needs electricity and the cost of electricity over time would probably exceed the bag usage!

## Best method to clean

Hydrogen peroxide (3%) - spray

- [walmart 8 floz spray, $2](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-3-Hydrogen-Peroxide-Topical-Solution-Antiseptic-Spray-8-fl-oz/779959287)
- Safer than bleach for interiors
- Spray → wait 10 min → blot
- Effective on fabrics and carpet

## Alternative Methods to Clean

### White vinegar (undiluted)

- Spray on hard surfaces, seat fabric, carpets
- Let sit 10–15 min, then wipe/blot
- Kills ~80–90% of mold species

### 70% isopropyl alcohol

- Excellent for plastics, vinyl, leather (spot test)
- Fast-evaporating, no residue


### Quaternary ammonium disinfectant

- Stronger, prevents regrowth
- Lysol, Concrobium Mold Control

### Heat via steam cleaning

## Best solutions

- Air treatment
    - ozone treatment
        - [$50 home depot ozone generator (O3, reactive to mold)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/SKYSHALO-Ozone-Machine-3230-Sq-Ft-HEPA-Type-Ozone-Generator-in-Gray-Odor-Remover-Commercial-Home-Air-Ionizers-Deodorizer-GYCYFSQ0120MZSKULV1-0726/331935852?)
        - Run for 30min -> 2 hours with all doors/windows closed (run 1-2 times)
        - Wipe/vaccuum mold prior, because it kills spores rather than colonies
    - chlorine dioxide treatment (professional)
- seat foam replacement
