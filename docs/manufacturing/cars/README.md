# Cars

I work at cars 1-2 times a week at [https://www.autoangels.org/](https://www.autoangels.org/).

It is a nonprofit started in 2005. We provide free labor for people in the community through the [affiliated nonprofits](https://www.autoangels.org/get-help/). Therefore, nobody can just come through as repair their own cars unfortunately :(. 

It is located at a church in Bellevue, WA (20 car garage), but there isn't a mandatory religious affiliation requirement (I am not affiliated). 

I have accumulated my own tools and skills to work on cars, so feel free to shoot me an email if you need help! <a href="mailto:ab18gu@gmail.com">ab18gu@gmail.com</a>
