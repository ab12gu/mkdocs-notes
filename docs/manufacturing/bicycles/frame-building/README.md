# Frame Building

A good place to start might be to just have a steel bike and make upgrades to it. 

Adding threaded mounting points to the frame for rack or light attachements. 

- PEM nuts into drilled hole into steel fork

Alternatively, you can get P-clamps so you don't need to "damage" the frame.
