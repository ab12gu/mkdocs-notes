[DISC BRAKE PAD BP-L04C-MF METAL WITH FIN](https://bike.shimano.com/en-NA/products/service-and-upgrade-parts/pdp.P-BP-L04C-MF.html)

- Sintered metal (powdered metal compacted & heated)
- Works better in wet conditions
- Squeals in wet
- Better heat transfer than resin
- retains more constant friction until 400-500C

## Cooling fins

There is not much research on performance of fins on brake pads. It is really just a marketing/aesthetic gimmic. One study shows 8% of heat reduction through breakpad geometry, where 92% released through caliper.
