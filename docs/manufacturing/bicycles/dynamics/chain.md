# Chain

Dirty chain testing:

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwkW0CY7qA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwkW0CY7qA)
- lose like 8 watts default by using chain
- lose up to 4 watts max with really dirty chain
- lose many watts if in small cog due to tighter rotation of each steel cylinder in the chain
    - 14.5 watts in smallest gear
    - and chain line didn’t make much difference
    - 7 watts on biggest gear :)
    - 1 watt = 5 seconds on a 25 miles time trial…
