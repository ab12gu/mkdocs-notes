# Crank Length

There is a growing consensus that shorter cranks are better. I do not agree. This idea is promoted by lack of human flexibility and shorter cranklength allows individuals to get away with that. 

In contrast, a longer crank lenght allows a rider to gain a greater range of motion, providing more distrubution of force across the leg muscles during pedalling. 

Your ideal crank length for road and gravel riding is about 21% â€“ 21.6% of your leg length

Rider shaves two minutes off of a 30-minute climb by going from a bike crank arm length that is 18.5% of their inner leg length to one that is 21% of that length

Mountain bike ~ 1% lower

## Crank based on my measurements

Inseam length: 900 mm

Crank length recommendation (21%): 189 mm
