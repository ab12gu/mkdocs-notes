# 3D Printing

Resin printing is really nice quality, but I haven't really used it much. Future me. 

I mostly just print in PLA due to large availability in makerspaces. It probably is cheaper too, but haven't compared the pricing too much. 

## Printers

Bambu labs is the most "popular" brand as of 2026 due to reliability + price. The at-home project printer is the [a1-mini](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) ranging from `$200-$400` based on sales and if you get enclosure. 

I currently own 2 Ender 3 printers that need to be repaired (one bought from Teddy for $50, and the other is free from tool library)
