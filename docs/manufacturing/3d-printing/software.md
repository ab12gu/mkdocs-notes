## Other Software

Someone at the cap hill tool library was working on developing a software for interfacing with 3d printers for the blind as a passion project, [https://github.com/tdeck/3dmake](https://github.com/tdeck/3dmake)

## Slicing Software

Slicing software

- [https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer)
    - Most software for 3d printing is just a fork of this software (including bambu)
    - Build off of https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r
    - Using prusaslicer for bambu will just have some features not included like flow optimization and vibration reduction, but still should work
