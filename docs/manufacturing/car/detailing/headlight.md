# Headlight

Material - polycarbonate instead of traditional glass

- UV breaks down outer clear coat
- Microscratches scatter light, making it look blurry
- 

## Fix

- Wash w/ soap and water
- Mask off outside of headlight with tape
- Sand headlight w/ 800 grit, then 1500, then 2000
- Use plastic polish or restoration kit, removing fine sanding marks
- Seal w/ ceramic UV coat
    - Plastic-specific or headlight-specific UV sealant, as metal ones formulated differently?
    - I bet metal ceramic works fine...
