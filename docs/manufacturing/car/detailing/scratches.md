## Car paint layers

1. Clear Coat (40-50 microns)
2. Base Coat (10-25 microns) - car paint color
3. Primer (20-30 microns)
    - Bare metal/plastic/fiberglass doesn't hold paint well
    - Chemically bonds to surface, also sealing surface from rust
    1. Etching Primer
        - First layer (using contains mild acid, phosphoric acid) to "bite" into bare metal
        - Thin film, needs supplemental epoxy/urethane primer
        - Used for aluminum panels (generally higher end, not honda/toyotas)
    2. Epoxy Primer
        - Two parts: resin + hardener
        - Not as strong as etch as it mechancial adheres
        - Needs to be sanded to adhere
        - Also pretects from rust
        - 
    3. Urethane Primer
        - 2k version sprayed thick and sanded down
        - Used ontop of epoxy primer
        - 
4. 180-220 grit sanding on epoxy primer
5. Sealer (optional)
6. Basecoat
    - Color of car
7. Clearcoat
    - Protects from UV, scratches, chemicals
    - Gives gloss & depth

## Repair clear coat

Polishing pad + compound acts like super-fine sandpaper — it shaves down a microscopic layer of clear coat until the scratch is level with the surrounding surface

Compound is generally just a more aggressive version of liquid polisher, used like sandpaper

1. clean panel with car shampoo or soap to make sure grit does scratch surface again
2. buffing [sponge pads](https://www.amazon.com/SPTA-Backing-Compound-Polishing-Polisher/dp/B07STT35FF?s=automotive&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&linkId=3c1fbcb5451c957e1ccf480f2d71ce18&language=en_US) for polishing/waxing - $16-$27
    - Fit for 3" -> 7" backing plate.
    - Green T120 (more coarse, deeper cuts)
    - Yellow T80 
    - Orange T60
    - Blue T40 
    - Red T20 (more fine)
- Held in place w/ velcro
- Damp polisher with water and run to remove excess
- Pour a circle of polishing compound on sponge
- Start on low on car to prevent throwing off the compound
- Increase speed when compound embedded into sponge
- Add some water if gets too dry
3. wipe with microfiber cloth
4. Spray with wax and rub microfiber cloth over it

Polisher - 650W (no need for more power)

Microfiber’s ultra-fine fibers lift dirt away instead of dragging it. Doesn't leave lint like cotton. Can hold 8x its weight in liquid.

- 300–400 GSM grams per square meter
- thick enough to be safe, but not so plush they soak up all your polish before wiping
- higher gsm is thiccer 

## Equipment

Drill Speed

- Low-speed polishing: 500–1500 RPM
- Medium-speed cutting/polishing: 1500–2500 RPM
- High-speed (pro-only, rotary polishers): 2500–4500+ RPM

Drill Torque

- polishing requires only ~50 in-lb (5–6 Nm)
