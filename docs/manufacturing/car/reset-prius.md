# Reset Prius

- clear the code manually using a scan tool that supports ABS (not all OBD2 readers do)
- "paperclip reset" or pedal dance (below), but these don't always work on Gen 2 Priuses

## Paperclip reset

1. Turn the ignition OFF.
2. Use a paperclip or jumper wire to short terminals 4 (CG) and 13 (TC) on the OBD2 connector.
3. Turn ignition ON (not START), wait for the ABS light to start blinking.
4. After a few seconds, remove the jumper and turn the ignition OFF.
5. Start the car normally â€” if successful, the warning light may be off.
