# Wiper Blades

Conventional wiper blades were designed to pair with vintage, flat windshields. Contemprary adhere more to curved windows and have aerodynamic designs.

Generally wiperblades will last about 12 months. The rubber dries out from being outside all year and not much you can do about it

Extended life blades may last 2 years and are a few dollars more...

Beam blades are better
