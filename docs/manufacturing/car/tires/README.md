Lowest priced tires @ [Discount Tires](https://discounttire.com) (See `Alternative Shops` page for alternatives)

- ~$200-250 for 4 tires
- +$100 for installation
- =$350 total w/ 50k warrenty + free re-balancing

You cannot really replace your own tires reasonably. Even if you were able to put on new tires with some lever, you cant reasonably balance the tires. Discount Tires also lets you rebalance for free, which should be done once a year, so that in itself is worth the $100 installation fee.

## Example Tire

For 2002 EX Honda Civic (Naia's car):

- Tire Specs: 15" rim, ~25" tire (185/65 R15)
- Purchased: [milestar-ms932-sport/p/19327](https://www.discounttire.com/buy-tires/milestar-ms932-sport/p/19327)

"I understand that you are comparing two tires, #19327 Milestar and [#102478](https://www.discounttire.com/buy-tires/cooper-endeavor/p/102478) Cooper Endeavor. The additional cost for tire #102478 is primarily due to the Cooper name and the additional costs that go with being a name brand, which may not seem justified given the performance comparison you noted. The Cooper's are a better tire, but not twice as good. The Cooper's are most likely manufactured in the US which will also drive up the price. "

In contrast, [Hancook/Kinergy](https://www.discounttire.com/buy-tires/hankook-kinergy-pt-h737/p/149280) tire has a warrenty of 90k, being double the price. That might be worth it tbh...but like... your really just saving on avoiding a early trip to replace them.

## What to look for

Find a tire with a 50k+ mileage guarentee. The average life may say lower, like 30k, but probably wrong if guarentee is longer... 

Give item # to check if store has in stock (item: 19327)

- Online has different availability then calling (different system)
- A few days to get tires

If you have to spend an extra $10 per tire for longer tire life/warrenty, do it

- if tire life doubles in price, the tire will not last double the time
    - those tires may have a warrenty of 65k...
    - decide if replacing your tires a year later is worth the extra few hundred in cost

Threads are generally the same tbh, so don't read into it. If snow driving... then look into it.

Average driving distance is about 10k per year. That means you will roughly replace your tires every 5 years.
