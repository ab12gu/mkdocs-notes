# Repair

## Spare Tire

Smaller than original tire

- Less traction on ground
- Wear out quicker

## Nail/Leak in Tire

Rubber patch kits ~$5, no need to replace. 

A shop may say nail is too close to sidewall to patch, which may be true. But you can do some risk assessment and evaluate. (advised that repair be 1/2 inch away or more from the edge)

## Valve Stem Replacement

The rubber should meet SAE JI205-JI206 to ensure prevention of dry rot (e.g. [EPDM rubber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FthJtLXWX5w))

1. If you have the tire off, just make sure to put the valve in before putting on the tire.
2. If tire is on, you push valve in with pliers. 
3. Or you can use a funnel + lube [to push valve in](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EDwtSx8M6Ng)
4. Or you can push tire back with car tire lever tools

## TPMS

Tire pressure monitoring systems were installed around 2007 onward.

- Two types: rubber or metal. 
- They are installed inside of valve stem within tire.
- Battery lasts about 7-10 years
