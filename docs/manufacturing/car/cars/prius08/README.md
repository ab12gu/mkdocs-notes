# My Car

I own a [prius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius) 2008 Touring model. It was bought new from mom in 2008/9.

[Owner's manual](https://assets.sia.toyota.com/publications/en/om-s/OM08W1QG/pdf/2008_Prius_QRG_lr.pdf)

You can tell that it is a touring model because it has separate front fog lights and HID headlight bulbs (higher lumens than halogen).
