        - Average life says 35k... which is probably wrong lol
    - There are tires slightly cheaper, but average life/mileage warrenty doesn't equivicate
    - The more expensive tires only have warrenties to 65k miles, but are double the price so not worth it unless you value to time it takes to replace them :)

    - Replace average 4-6 years due to wear

## Tire Maintenance

If you leava your car sitting for while, you can create a flatspot on the tire :(

### Tire Balancing

You will notice your steering wheel/seat/or/floorboard vibate >45 mph. Heavier vehicles dampen vibrations so they have less imbalances overtime.

If your tires spins unevently/has vibration, you can use a balancing machine to measure rotation 

- dynamic imbalance
- then the shop will add [tire weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuJQTDjmN1U) to wheel to create even rotation
    - Types:
        - 1: Knock on wheel weights (clip onto rim of wheel) (most common)
        - 2: Adhesive wheel weights inside wheel
    - 1/4 ounce -> 4+ ounces
The tire may also become oval shapped

- static imbalance
- the shop will rotate the tire low point to the wheel's high point to get more roundedness

Rebalance recommended 6k miles, which is between 1/2 -> 1 year

- Free balancing of tires if bought from [discount tires](https://www.discounttire.com/learn/tire-balancing)
