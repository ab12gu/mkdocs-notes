Lowest priced tires @ [Discount Tires](https://discounttire.com) (See [alt](#Alternative-Shops) section for alternatives)

- ~$200-250 for 4 tires
- +$100 for installation
- =$350 total w/ 50k warrenty + free re-balancing

You cannot really replace your own tires reasonably. Even if you were able to put on new tires with some lever, you cant reasonably balance the tires. Discount Tires also lets you rebalance for free, which should be done once a year, so that in itself is worth the $100 installation fee.

## Example Tire

For 2002 EX Honda Civic (Naia's car):

- Tire Specs: 15" rim, ~25" tire (185/65 R15)
- Purchased: [milestar-ms932-sport/p/19327](https://www.discounttire.com/buy-tires/milestar-ms932-sport/p/19327)

"I understand that you are comparing two tires, #19327 Milestar and [#102478](https://www.discounttire.com/buy-tires/cooper-endeavor/p/102478) Cooper Endeavor. The additional cost for tire #102478 is primarily due to the Cooper name and the additional costs that go with being a name brand, which may not seem justified given the performance comparison you noted. The Cooper's are a better tire, but not twice as good. The Cooper's are most likely manufactured in the US which will also drive up the price. "

In contrast, [Hancook/Kinergy](https://www.discounttire.com/buy-tires/hankook-kinergy-pt-h737/p/149280) tire has a warrenty of 90k, being double the price. That might be worth it tbh...but like... your really just saving on avoiding a early trip to replace them.

## What to look for

Find a tire with a 50k+ mileage guarentee. The average life may say lower, like 30k, but probably wrong if guarentee is longer... 

Give item # to check if store has in stock (item: 19327)

- Online has different availability then calling (different system)
- A few days to get tires

If you have to spend an extra $10 per tire for longer tire life/warrenty, do it

- if tire life doubles in price, the tire will not last double the time
    - those tires may have a warrenty of 65k...
    - decide if replacing your tires a year later is worth the extra few hundred in cost

Threads are generally the same tbh, so don't read into it. If snow driving... then look into it.

Average driving distance is about 10k per year. That means you will roughly replace your tires every 5 years.

If you change tire size, you would need to recalibrate your speedometer...

You could buy a low resistance tire to save some money. These have thinner sidewalls, shallower tread blocks and specialized rubber compounds. According to the USTMA, even as little as a 10% improvement in rolling efficiency can reduce fuel costs by up to $36/year (assuming gas is $3/gallon). Therefore older tires are more efficient due to less thread.

## Tire Maintenance

If you leava your car sitting for while, you can create a flatspot on the tire :(

Tires absorb heat and long-term exposure to sunlight can cause serious damage. Tires should be stored away from equipment that produces ozone, which can cause ozone cracking or dry rot. [link](https://www.discounttire.com/learn/tire-storage)

Check your tire (and spare tire) pressures once a month.

The Department of Energy has found that underinflated tires can decrease fuel efficiency by 0.4% for every 1 psi drop in the pressure of all four tires. Also, gas usage increases significantly as you exceed 60 miles per hour

There can be around a 10% change in energy due to rolling resistance for EVs vs 4% for gas.

If your vehicle was built after 2007, it came equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). The official TPMS symbol is a yellow exclamation mark inside a tire cross-section. This symbol will light up on your vehicle's dashboard when the recommended level of tire air pressure drops by 25% or more.

### Tire Balancing

You will notice your steering wheel/seat/or/floorboard vibate >45 mph. Heavier vehicles dampen vibrations so they have less imbalances overtime.

If your tires spins unevently/has vibration, you can use a balancing machine to measure rotation 

1. This is called **Dynamic imbalance**
    - then the shop will add [tire weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuJQTDjmN1U) to wheel to create even rotation
        - Types:
            - 1: Knock on wheel weights (clip onto rim of wheel) (most common)
            - 2: Adhesive wheel weights inside wheel
        - 1/4 ounce -> 4+ ounces

The tire may also become oval shapped

2. This is called **Static Imbalance**
    - the shop will rotate the tire low point to the wheel's high point to get more roundedness

Rebalance recommended 6k miles, which is between 1/2 -> 1 year. But you can just kinda note if you have been driving in poor conditions or if feel some misalignment and go to shop to adjust. Free if bought @ [discount tires](https://www.discounttire.com/learn/tire-balancing).

## Tire Rotation

Threads wear out in front of car (due to higher weight of engine) first. So, good to swap the back and front tires to extend the life of car. Free if bought @ [discount tires](https://www.discounttire.com/learn/tire-balancing).

## Tire Breakdown

All tires are constructed of rubber and cord layers referred to as "plies".

- Types: Passenger || Heavy-duty
- [Load](https://www.discounttire.com/learn/load-range-load-index): Generai (SL) for standard load 

## Increasing MPG



## Spare Tire

Smaller than original tire

- Less traction on ground
- Wear out quicker

## Brands

- Name Brands:
    - General
    - Michelin
    - Bridgestones
    - Continental
    - Goodyear

## Nail/Leak in Tire

Rubber patch kits ~$5, no need to replace. 

A shop may say nail is too close to sidewall to patch, which may be true. But you can do some risk assessment and evaluate. (advised that repair be 1/2 inch away or more from the edge)

## Valve Stem Replacement

The rubber should meet SAE JI205-JI206 to ensure prevention of dry rot (e.g. [EPDM rubber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FthJtLXWX5w))

1. If you have the tire off, just make sure to put the valve in before putting on the tire.
2. If tire is on, you push valve in with pliers. 
3. Or you can use a funnel + lube [to push valve in](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EDwtSx8M6Ng)
4. Or you can push tire back with car tire lever tools

## Removing and Installing Tire

- Might need soapy water to reduce friction

## Historical Notes

In the past, 15'' rims were the average wheel size. Today, the average wheel size has leaped upward to around 18 inches. And many cars come off the lot with wheels as big as (if not bigger than) 22''.

This larger rim size and shorter tire sidewall combo typically provide crisp handling and responsive performance. But enhanced handling doesn't happen without compromise. These features make vehicles more sensitive to vibration forces.

Conventional wiper blades were designed to pair with vintage, flat windshields. Contemprary adhere more to curved windows and have aerodynamic designs.
