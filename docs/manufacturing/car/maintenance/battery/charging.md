## Setup

- Battery phone bank: 5 volt output 
- 13.5 -> 14.4 volts

## Charging 

Check current battery voltage

- if under 10.5v, its damaged
- full charge sets at 12.6/12.8 volts when car off

Charging rate

- Set boost module to output 13.2-13.8 volts
    - should charge in roughly 3 days, 40 hours
- Normal charges charge at 14.2-14.4 volts, but automatically drop to 13.6 when charged at 80% charge
    - I'm not doing that so just charge slow...


## Wiring

Only 2 pairs of Black/Red wires needed

- Positive/Negative from usb output of Portable Charger
    - Goes to input of Boost Module
- Boost Module output to Positive/Negative of the Battery

USB A 2.0 (no data transfer):

NOTE: 3.0 has 5 pins for RxTx (UART serial) data transfer in addition to the normal D-D+ USB Differential Pair.

- The old protocol is more complex because data is transferred back and forth on the same line
