# Battery

Two batteries on car, 12 volt auxiliary battery and hybrid batter

## 12 volt auxiliary battery

- powers relays + electronics
- usually batteries show CCA (cold crank amperage) rather than Ah

Specs:

- Toyota Part Number: 28800-21171
- Battery Type: AGM (Absorbant Glass Mat), sealed, maintenance-free, vented
- Voltage: 12v
- Capacity: 45 Ah (20-hour rate)
    - can deliver 2.25 amps continuously for 20 hours (2.25 A × 20 h ≈ 45 Ah)
    - before reaching cutoff voltage 10.5v
- lead-acid battery
- Reserve Capcity: 66 minutes
- 

## Troubleshooting

- “Dead” battery (say, ~11.3 V), it might still have ~10–15 Ah left
- So instead of 45 Ah needed to charge, its 30Ah


## Hybrid battery (200 volts)

- spins ("cranks") the engine via motor generator, MG1
