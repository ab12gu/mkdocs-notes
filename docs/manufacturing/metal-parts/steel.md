# Steel

Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon

- high elastic modulus, yield strength, fracture strength
- carbon content of steel is between 0.02% and 2.14% by weight

The ductility and elongation of the pure iron state decrease upon the addition of carbon

## Steel Grades

[SAE steel grades system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_steel_grades) is a standard alloy numbering system

### Major classifications of steel

| SAE Designation | Steel Type                        |
|:---------------:|:----------------------------------|
| 1xxx            | Carbon steels                     |
| 2xxx            | Nickel steels                     |
| 3xxx            | Nickel-chromium steels            |
| 4xxx            | Molybdenum steels                 |
| 5xxx            | Chromium steels                   |
| 6xxx            | Chromium-vanadium steels          |
| 7xxx            | Tungsten steels                   |
| 8xxx            | Nickel-chromium-molybdenum steels |
| 9xxx            | Silicon-manganese steels          |

## Cast Iron

- higher than 2.1% carbon content are known as cast iron
- cast iron is not malleable even when hot
- can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel 
 
## Wrought iron

- iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.05%) 
- [1008 hot rolled strip steel](https://www.kloecknermetals.com/products/bar/hot-rolled-bar/aisi-1008-hot-rolled-strips/) usually used to form wrought products
    - low-carbon, non-alloy steel
    - standard shapes of metal, such as sheets, rods, plates, and bars that are later worked into a unique form
    - high thermal conductivity
    - low-carbon steel that yields excellent weldability
    - low electrical conductivity
    - low tensile strength
    - High ductility makes AISI 1008 steel great for screw machining

## Carbon Steel (mild steel)

- carbon content from about 0.05 up to 2.1 percent by weight.

Mild Steel

- contains approximately 0.05–0.30% carbon
    - most common form of steel because its price is relatively low while it provides material properties that are acceptable for many applications
    - making it malleable and ductile
    - relatively low tensile strength, but it is cheap and easy to form
- surface hardness can be increased with carburization
- the density of mild steel is approximately 7.85 g/cm3 (7,850 kg/m3; 0.284 lb/cu in)
- the Young's modulus is 200 GPa (29×106 psi)

## Stainless steels

- typically contain 18% chromium 
- exhibit improved corrosion and oxidation resistance 
- 

## Alloys

Common alloying elements include: 

- manganese
- nickel
- chromium
- molybdenum
- boron
- titanium
- vanadium
- tungsten
- cobalt
- niobium

Additional elements, most frequently considered undesirable:

- phosphorus
- sulphur
- silicon
- traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper
