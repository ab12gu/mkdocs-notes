# Pin Tumbler Locks

![](images/pin-tumbler.png)

- Also known as Yale lock, uses pins of various lengths to prevent lock from turning without correct key to push pins
- Most commonly used on residential and commerical doors, but also in padlocks
- 5-pin cylinders are very widespread in home locks, but for added security, may use 6/7 pins

## Duplicate Keys

- Filer + Sharpie
- Cast mold

## Common Keys

The KW1 keyway by Kiwiset, is the most common key for residental locks.

## Tolerances

### Typical Pin Length Tolerances

| Type               | Tolerance                         | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Master pins        | ±0.001 to ±0.002 in (±0.025–0.05 mm) | Master wafers must be very consistent to avoid creating vulnerabilities. |
| Bottom pins        | ±0.0015 to ±0.003 in (±0.038–0.076 mm) | These are the pins that align with the key cuts.                      |
| Top pins (drivers) | ±0.001 to ±0.003 in (±0.025–0.076 mm) | Tighter tolerances improve resistance to lock picking.               |
| Shear line tolerance (total clearance) | ~0.003 to 0.006 in (0.076–0.15 mm) | This is the key measurement that determines how precisely a key must match. |

### KW1 Key Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Center-to-center spacing | 0.123" |
| Pin diameter | 0.115" |
| Edge-to-edge clearance | 0.008" |

## KW1 Tolerances

For KW1 keyways tolerances are relatively loose compared to high-security locks. 

Spacing:

- Center-to-center spacing: 0.123"  
- 0.115"    || pin diameter
- 0.008"    || edge-to-edge clearance

### KW1 Key & Pin Specifications

| Feature                  | Typical Value                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Key cuts depth range     | 1 to 6 (Kwikset uses 6 depth increments)           |
| Cut depth increments     | 0.023" (0.584 mm)                                  |
| Bottom pin lengths       | ~0.169" to ~0.284"                                 |
| Pin length tolerance     | ±0.0015" to ±0.003" (0.038–0.076 mm)               |
| Shear line clearance     | ~0.004" to 0.006" (0.10–0.15 mm) total clearance   |
| Driver pin tolerance     | ±0.002" typical        

### KW1 Bottom Pin Lengths by Depth

| Depth | Approx. Pin Length (inches) |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| 1     | 0.284"                      |
| 2     | 0.261"                      |
| 3     | 0.238"                      |
| 4     | 0.215"                      |
| 5     | 0.192"                      |
| 6     | 0.169"                      |

### KW1 Key Pin Spacing

| Pin Position | Distance from Shoulder (in) | Notes                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1            | 0.231"                      | Closest to shoulder stop  |
| 2            | 0.354"                      |                           |
| 3            | 0.477"                      |                           |
| 4            | 0.600"                      |                           |
| 5            | 0.723"                      | Tip of key                |
|              |                             |                           |
| Spacing      | 0.123"                      | Between each pin center   |
