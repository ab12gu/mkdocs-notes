    - $170
    - Recommended by Greg due to noise level
    - Used for tougher bolts
    - limitation: needs bits with hex collet (1/4")
        - many drillbits don't have a hex collet (spade, forstneer, even standard)
        - cant limit overdriving with torque limiter that drills have
            - but can work if u know ur impact driver well, generally not as smooth

## Common Drill Motor Specs

Most common consumer-grade drills use motors like:

- 775 DC Motor (commonly seen in 12V–24V drills)
- Brushed, high RPM (~18,000 RPM no-load)
- Geared down inside the drill to ~1200–1800 RPM at the chuck
- Stall current: 15–60 A depending on voltage
- Motor resistance: ~0.2–1.0 Ω depending on design

'''V=I⋅R, @ stall current'''

'''τ=Kt⋅I, Kt is torque constant'''

## Speed vs Torque

High speed only makes job faster but doesn't really provide much else, and can be done with higher torque drills

- Soft material, for quickness, use high speed
- Hard material use higher torque

Drills generally have a gear 1 (high torque) or gear 2 (high speed) options

- So at stall torque of gear 2, you a factor less than high torque of gear 1
- aka: gear 2 has a lower mechanical advantage

When you increase the speed with no load, it stops spinning indefinately cause the back emf reduces operating voltage

- back emf occurs due to motor spinning

If you change the operating torque, but not the speed in a drill, you are reducing the applied voltage to motor


## Common Motors Used in Drills

---

### 1. Brushed DC Motors

**Types:**  

- 775 size motor (industrial standard)  
- 550 size motor (smaller, less powerful)  

**Typical Specs:**  

- Voltage: 12 V to 24 V (cordless), up to ~120 V DC (corded, rectified)  
- No-load speed: ~15,000–20,000 RPM (motor shaft)  
- Geared down to ~1200–1800 RPM at chuck  

**Torque Constant \(K_t\):**  

- Approximately **0.02 to 0.06 Nm/A**  
- Higher power motors have lower \(K_t\) (higher speed, less torque per amp)  

**Motor Winding Resistance:**  

- Ranges from **0.1 Ω to 1.0 Ω** depending on size and voltage rating  
- Larger motors → lower resistance (~0.1–0.3 Ω)  
- Smaller motors → higher resistance (~0.5–1.0 Ω)  

### 2. Brushless DC Motors (BLDC)

**Types:**  

- 3-phase brushless motors, custom windings for torque-speed profile  

**Typical Specs:**  

- Voltage: 18 V to 60 V (common cordless tool batteries)  
- No-load speed: 20,000+ RPM (motor shaft)  
- Gear reduction to desired chuck speed  

**Torque Constant \(K_t\):**  

- Typically **0.02 to 0.07 Nm/A**  
- More efficient with better torque curves than brushed m

## Motor Torque

- A 550 motor drawing 5 A would produce around 0.2 Nm of torque.

## Stall Currents for 550 and 775 Motors

Stall current can be much higher than rated continuous current. A drill may briefly draw 15–30 A during stall or heavy load, increasing torque proportionally.

| Motor Model       | Rated Voltage | Terminal Resistance (Ω) | Stall Current (A) |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **550 Motor**     | 12V            | ~0.5 – 0.8 Ω              | 15 – 24 A         |
| **775 Motor**     | 18V / 24V      | ~0.2 – 0.4 Ω              | 45 – 90 A         |

Larger gear ratios:

Reflected inertia grows with the square of the gear ratio:

- J_reflected = J_load × (gear ratio)^2
- T = J × α
- P = T × ω

High inertia requires higher torque to overcome, so requires more current draw

- may lead to running into stall current before accelerating, so no movement :(
