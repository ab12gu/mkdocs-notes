    - power level in decibels (dB)
    - voltage level
- Signal paths are either
    - single-ended
    - balanced

## Digital Audio Signal Transfer Methods

- optical fiber 
    - light waves sent through plastic tube
- coaxial cable 
    - ground/negative surrounding positive
- or, twistsed pair cable 
    - positive and negative in separate lines
