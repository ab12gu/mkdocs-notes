# Audio

The main reason this page was created was to get these passive speakers I found on the ground to work. It has lead to a larger development into the topic :). 

## Audible Range

Hearing range describes the frequency range that can be heard by humans

- human hearing range: **20 - 20,000 Hz**
- however, high pitches get harder to hear as we age
- a basic measure of hearing is afforded by an audiogram
- involves tones being presented at specific frequencies (pitch) and intensities (loudness).

## Audio Characteristics

Characterized by parameters

- bandwidth
- nominal level
- power level in decibels (dB)
- voltage level


Signal paths are either

- single-ended
- balanced

## Digital Audio Signal Transfer Methods

- optical fiber 
    - light waves sent through plastic tube
- coaxial cable 
    - ground/negative surrounding positive
- or, twisted pair cable 
    - positive and negative in separate lines
