Output:
- Optical was the best digital connection prior to HDMI. It's limited to 1.4Mbps (IIRC) so it was enough for raw CD audio or Dolby Digital/AC3 (640kbps). 
-  But HDMI will do 7 channels or RAW PCM and compressed audio at ridiculous sampling rates (24 bit 192khz) so there is just no need for optical anymore.
