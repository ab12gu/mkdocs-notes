[Reddit discussion on how to power](https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/177j4kz/no_idea_how_to_hook_sony_ssb1000_speakers/)

- Little cheapo amp off of Temu for five bucks and hook it up to the speakers
- It has bluetooth so you can just connect your phone to it and away you go.
- Just search "Bluetooth Amp" on Temu or AliExpress or Ebay or Amazon.
- need a power supply which may not be included. It's similar to a phone charger but probably 12 volts, or maybe 24 volts
