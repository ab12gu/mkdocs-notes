Sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave

Sound that is perceptible by humans has frequencies (acoustic waves):
- 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (audio frequency range)

In air at atmospheric pressure, wavelengths of sound waves range:
- 17 m (56 ft) to 17 mm (0.67 in)

Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and are not audible to humans.
The particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave
