# Roti

You can grind up grains to make flour at home too!

## Ingredients

- Wheat Flour (atta) 1 cup = ~10 rotis
- Water (lukewarm; hotter the water, the more water absorbed (boiled ok))
    - 2:1 Flour to Water ratio
- Pinch of salt

Add ons:

- Oil (unsure if can do without)***
- chili flakes
- garlic
- cilantro
- Pinch of sugar
- 1 tablespoon yogurt for softness

## Atta

I need to self test the amount of atta concentrations for best output. 

- 60% whole wheat atta
- 20% multigrain atta (fiber)
- 15% besan (protein/fiber)
- 5% soy flour (protein)

If eaten with high protein dishes, might be better to go with higher fiber mix (or vise versa).

- All-pupose flour is too fine for rotis.
- More Fiber, needs more water, needs more rest time
- In room, can rest too long, but not in fridge

## Steps

1. Mix atta and salt (and add oil?)
2. Periodically add more water to get dough to stick together
3. Mix with fingers
4. Cover and let dough sit for 5-15 minutes
    - for dough to soak up water
    - damp cloth prevents drying, slimy surface
5. Knead the dough for 1 min (with some oil and flour)
5. (2) Let it rest for another 10+ minutes
6. Break parts of dough out into small balls
7. Put into flour, and roll into tortilla (16-18cm, 7-8in)
8. Add Roti to hot pan (too low and turns into papad?)
