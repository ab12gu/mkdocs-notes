    - frozen berries + honey


For the pb&j tortillas, you can just do pb+banana instead of jam...

- free bananas in SLU, grab with dog walk

Alt:

- Add chia seeds or flax seeds to give more fats/fiber/protein
- Use pb protein powder + water to get pb taste
- Maybe when pb protein works, but may have artificial sweeteners
