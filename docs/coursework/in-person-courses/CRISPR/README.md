CRISPR, or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a gene-editing tool that has revolutionized gene editing across various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. 

In this five-week course, you will learn how to edit genes using plasmids in bacteria, visualize proteins and DNA in biotechnological software, and analyze DNA sequencing results. We will also explore the origins of CRISPR technology, broader applications of CRISPR in the real world, and ethical considerations in its usage. This course is suitable for anyone ages 12 and up.

Learnings
- Safely handle bacterial cultures in the laboratory
- Transform bacterial cultures with CRISPR-editing DNA plasmids
- Perform DNA extraction and mini-prep to purify DNA
- Use computational software for DNA design, protein structure, and analyzing DNA sequences
- Discuss the central dogma of molecular biology
- Discuss the broader applications of CRISPR technology
