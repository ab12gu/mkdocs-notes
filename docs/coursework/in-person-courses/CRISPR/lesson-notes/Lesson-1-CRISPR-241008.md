DNA replicated from DNA polymerase

DNA Strip - Helix
- Nucleotides
    - 4 different nucleotides
    - G C A T
    - G pairs w/ C
    - A pairs w/ T
    - G/A called purines
    - C/T called pyrimidines

backbone
- 5', 3' on the backbone
- filled with sugar and phosphate
- phosphate attacked to the 5' end of the sugar-pentagon molecule
- count starts from the hydroxal group

Transcription
- Protein comes in and makes a inverse strand (RNA polymerase) || 'ase - means its an enzyme
- RNA formed: 5' ... AGCUUC ... 3'
- U replaces the T in strand
- change molecule by something like a hydrogen add on

Translation
- Ribosome (protein)
- The rna fed through the ribosome
- 3 base pair - tells ribosome of what type of amino acid
- 16 base pairs
- AGC, UUC
- N ... S -- Ph ... C

Virus
- Outside has: spike protein
- Human cell:  Ace2
- Attaches Ace2 <-> Spike Protein
- injects genome into the human cell

Crispr History

- 1987 - looking at ecoli
    - ecoli - common bacteria, (eg: k22 variant ecoli strain)
    - chipotle - pathogenic ecoli
    - found repeating segments every stretch and spacer sequences
    - spacer sequences - clustered regularly interspaced palandoming repeats
    - AATGGCAT
    - called "hairpins" - palindomes

- 1993
    - More CRISPR was found
    - People were lining up CRISPR sequences
    - Noticed some nucleotides changed over species thinking this might be a gene change evolutions
    - 

- Early 2000s
    - looking at spacer sequences
    - has homologous spacer sequences in viruses
    - if the bacteria had a spacer sequences the same as the virus, it won't be infected

- 2007
    - Yogurt company - Danisco
    - bacterial strain for culturing yogurt would get infected by bacteria phages
    - strepicocus thermophilic bacteria used to make yogurt
    - inserted a part of the bacteria phage into the yogurt bacteria
        - replace the spacer of the yogurt bacteria with virus
    - worked! no infections!
    - tased same/ same output

- 2008
    - the spacer sequences were transcribed into RNA
    - CAS - crispr associated genes - the sequence after the crispr sequence
    - CAS9 - can introduce double standed breaks into DNA (can cut a whole piece of dna rather half like Nickase, "nicks" dna, cuts half)
    - transactivating rna
    - guide rna tells where the cas9 should cut the DNA
    - tracRNA - segment of CAS
    - tracRNA + crRNA (segment of CRISPR) -> sgRNA (guide RNA)
    - we can: deactivate CAS0 -> dcas9
    - we decativate by creating 2 mutations dcas9 (in the cutting regions)
    - dCAS9 - we can add cool things to it (enzymes/proteins)
    - you can either add a new segment to a cut of a gene or kill a dna sequence by using a CAS9 double helix cut
