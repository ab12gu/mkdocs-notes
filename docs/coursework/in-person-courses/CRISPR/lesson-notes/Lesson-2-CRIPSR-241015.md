CRISPR Lesson 2


1. Add DNA (plasmids) to ecoli
2. Transformation --> 

Shine light 
- OD600
- Opitcal Density at 600 nm
- more ecoli, less light gets through

Solution
- Lag phase: Starts clear, low OD600, not many ecoli cells
- Log phase: Then exponential increases
- Stationary Phase: Levels off, crowded, lack of nutrientients 
- Dead Phase: Lack of nutrients/crowded :: ecoli starts dying

Example dish:
- ecoli - pink fluorcent 
- mfrp protein
- picked a colony and put into a liquid culture
- tied the colony to an antibiotic
- cells are resistant to ampicillin
- cells that don't uptake the dna die 

Subculture
- dilute and culture it again

p1000
- can pipette up to 100 -> 1000 microLiters


Lab:
- LB 
    - Luria Broth
    - Has nutrients that cells need to grow: amino acid, yeast extract for carbon source, salts, 
- Antibiotic
    - "carb" (carbonacillic) or "Ampacillian"
    - kills the microbe
    - 

- SBL001
    - strain of ecoli w/ added DNA (plasmid)
    - the plasmid is immune to the antibiotic
    - In a broth LB+carb and grown overnight
    - Will get rid of the plasmid
