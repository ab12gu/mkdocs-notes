[Talon SRX](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/talon-srx)

- speed controller
- cost: $90
- two new sensor types for CTRE Magnetic Encoder (absolute and relative)
- voltage compensation mode: 
	- Motor Output is expressed in output volts
	- Talon will modulate the output based on battery voltage measurement
- Current Closed-Loop Mode
	- Talon will servo to a target current-draw
- Specify the peak forward and reverse output during Closed-Loop
