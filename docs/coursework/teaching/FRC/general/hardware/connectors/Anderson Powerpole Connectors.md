Consist of two major parts: the **housing** and **contact**

The most common housing and contact used with the SPARK MAX is the 1327 series housing paired with the 45 amp contacts.

Connectors are genderless allowing all powerpole connectors to mate with themselves

Dovetails on each housing allow them to slide together.

After the housings are mated together adding a roll pin prevents the housings from become detached during operation. 

Each housing is fitted with a spring to retain the contacts after they are inserted

1327 series housings can use contacts rated for between 15 and 45 amps.

Tug slightly on the assembled connector to make sure the contacts are locked in place

Using 16 gauge or smaller wire in a 30 amp contact requires that you double or triple up the wire to fill the crimp receptacle of the contact to get a good crimp.

A properly crimped contact should have a minimum hold on the wire of more than 25 pounds. A pair of connectors should snap together with 6 to 8 pounds force.
