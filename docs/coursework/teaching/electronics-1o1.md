# Eletronics 101

Potential Course taught for Seattle Makers

Discussed w/ Sam on 25-12-11

- They have ~20 cases for Arduino starter kits:
    - `Super Starter Kit UNO R3 Project`
- Brandon & Hank were in Lab giving ideas as well
- Hank recommended to look at other curriculums
    - [Arduino docs](https://www.eitkw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arduino_Projects_Book.pdf)
    - [Sparkfun docs](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41)

### Class Specs

- Estimated Length of time: 2+ hours
- Estimated # of people: 3-6 people

### Things to cover

- Mulitmeter
- Ohm's Law: V = IR
- AC vs DC voltages
- High vs Low voltages
    - battery/outlet power
- Batteries in Parallel vs Series
- Some basic coding
- Parts of Arduino
- Run arduino off of battery vs computer/charger
- Applicance fuses/Home Fuses/Circuit Breakers

### Cool simple projects

- PWM control for server motor
- LED/Resistor Circuit via Arduino + Breadboard
    - why is a resistor needed
- Potentiometer to control music (synthesizer)
- Leds change color based on music

### Extra

Probably too far

- Capacitors
- RC filters
- analog output, passing in AC and removing DC
- Voltage Dividers
