Hello! This is my site for technical notes about anything I have learned or work(ed) on! Currently working on methods to render the images better, so they probably won't load :(, but it is in the sourcecode, [Gitub](https://github.com/ab12gu/mkdocs-notes).

## Categories

The docs are being broken down into multiple sections/types. 

e.g.

```python
1. Electronics    # technical electrical notes/projects
2. Audio          # tecnhical audio notes/projects
3. Recipes        # instructions for me to navigate to while cooking
...
```

## Source Code

I ported this over from my main porfolio webpage, [abgup.com](abgup.com), discuessed in the [README](https://github.com/ab12gu/mkdocs-notes). But in essence, the original website didn't support nested folders that is essential for documentation.
