Hello! This is my site for technical notes about anything I have learned or work(ed) on! Currently working on methods to render the images better, so they probably won't load :(, but it is in the sourcecode below.

## Categories

The docs are being broken down into multiple sections/types. 

e.g.

```python
1. Electronics    # technical electrical notes/projects
2. Audio          # tecnhical audio notes/projects
3. Recipes        # instructions for me to navigate to while cooking
...
```
