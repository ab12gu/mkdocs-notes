# Welcome to Blog

[blog.abgup.com](https://blog.abgup.com)

Currently, the blog is being ported over from main portfolio webpage. The reason behind it is discussed in the README. But in essences, the original website didn't support nested folders that is essential for documentation.

## Categories

The docs are being broken down into multiple sections/types. 

```python
1. Technical documentation/notes

2. Blog     # opinionated ideas of mostly software)
3. Recipes  # instructions for me to navigate to while cooking
```
