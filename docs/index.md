# Homepage

[blog.abgup.com](https://blog.abgup.com)


Currently, the blog is being ported over from main portfolio webpage. The reason behind it is discussed in the [README](https://github.com/ab12gu/mkdocs-notes). But in essence, the original website didn't support nested folders that is essential for documentation.

## Categories

The docs are being broken down into multiple sections/types. 

e.g.

```python
1. Electronics    # technical electrical notes/projects
2. Audio          # tecnhical audio notes/projects
3. Recipes        # instructions for me to navigate to while cooking
...
```
