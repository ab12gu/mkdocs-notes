# Homepage

[blog.abgup.com](https://blog.abgup.com)


Currently, the blog is being ported over from main portfolio webpage. The reason behind it is discussed in the [README](https://github.com/ab12gu/mkdocs-notes). But in essence, the original website didn't support nested folders that is essential for documentation.

## Categories

The docs are being broken down into multiple sections/types. 

```python
1. Notes    # mostly technical for projects i've worked/working on 
2. Blog     # opinionated ideas of mostly software
3. Recipes  # instructions for me to navigate to while cooking
```
