# Shoes

I wear "barefoot" shoes since start of covid

- no heel to toe drop aka soles are flat
- minimal foam support at bottom
    - some brands have more foam/thicker rubber on soles
    - as you get older, the bottom of foot can't take as much impact
        - but as you get used to no support, your steps become lighter


Brands been using: Xeros

- Xeros Prios in summer & Xero snowboots for winters
