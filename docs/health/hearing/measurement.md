# Measurement

Sound level meter 

- measures acoustics, generally a hand-held instrument with just a microphone...
- generally condenser microphone for stability/reliability
- diaphram responds to change in air pressure (pascals) caused by sound waves and is converted to a voltage reading

Decibels (dB) is usually logarithmic represntation of sound pressure with 0 dB SPL equal to 20 micropascals. 

However, the reading from a sound level meter does not correlate well to human-perceived loudness, which is better measured by a loudness meter.
