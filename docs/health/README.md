# Sodium Intake

If you’re training indoors, consider consuming 500-1500mg sodium per hour to prevent hydration issues. Quick info: Sodium citrate has about 1000mg sodium per tsp.  Table salt is about 2000mg sodium per tsp. Add either to your workout carb beverage.

**TL;DR:** 1/2 tsp of salt per hour workout
