# Ultraviolet Radiation (UV)

Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths of 10–400 nanometers. The lower limit is conventionally 400 nm, though isn't a sharp cutoff. It has violet in the name because it has the highest frequencies of visible light.

It generally isn't visible to humans


- Shorter than that of visible light
- Longer than X-rays
- ~10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun
- The photons of ultraviolet have greater energy than those of visible light
    - from about 3.1 to 12 electron volts
    - around the minimum energy required to ionize atoms

Wavelength Differences

- longer wavelength radiation
    - excite vibrational or rotational states of these molecules
    - increasing their temperature.
-  Short-wave ultraviolet light
      -  ionizing radiation 
      -  Consequently, short-wave UV damages DNA
      -  sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact
      -  "extreme" UV below 121 nm 
            -  ionizes air so is absorbed before it reaches the ground

## Eyes

- lens of the human eye blocks most radiation in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm
- shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea
- 

## Skin Cancer

Suntan and sunburn are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV,

- increased risk of skin cancer.
