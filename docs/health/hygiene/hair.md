# Hair

Kristie uses, [Shikakai powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegalia_rugata)

- Not much reputable or much discussion online about it
- Ayuvadic approach to shampoo
- does not produce the normal amount of lather that a sulfate-containing shampoo would
- mild, having a naturally low pH, and does not strip hair of natural oils
- An infusion of the leaves has been used in anti-dandruff preparations
- bark contains high levels of saponins, which are foaming agents
    - natural surfactants (allows oil/water to mix -- hydrophilic and hydrophobic side)
    - The hydrophobic tails trap the oil inside
	- The hydrophilic heads face outward into water
	- The trapped dirt/oil becomes suspended in water
        - so it can be rinsed away
