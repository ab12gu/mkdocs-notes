# Skin

**TL;DR** Just go in the sun in morning/evening

## Showers

- Limit hot showers 5-10 minutes
- Moistures within 3 minutes of showering

## Topicals

- Rabomicine - anti-aging - causes acne
- CeraVe - acne control cleanser, salicylic acid 2% - acne/blemish free (unnecessary imo) 
- accutane 2x 40mg (unnecessary)
- No topicals really work anywhere close to lasers and physical stuff
    - as you age, you lose firmness of the skin 
    - Bryan Johnson rec: Tixel - thermal mechanical ablasian w/ intense pulses of heat
        - Lasers/RF having pros/cons compared to tixel

## Lotion

- [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/moisturizers-do-they-work](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/moisturizers-do-they-work)
- Mix of moisture soaking, moisture, and moisture blocking agents
    - Moisture soaks from the air and inner parts of skin
    - Most contain water as first ingredient
    - The grease blocks moisture from releasing from skin
