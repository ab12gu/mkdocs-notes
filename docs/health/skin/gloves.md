# Gloves

For car repair use `Nitrile` gloves

    - Synthetic rubber, specifically nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR)
- `Latex:` degrade/swell in oils, easilty tears
    - Natural rubber latex from trees!
    - Kristie recommends [Black Dragon, heavy Latex gloves](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dragon+gloves)
        - $14 for 100
    - flexible, but may cause allergic reactions
- `Vinyl:` similar to Nitrile, but less chemical resistant, cheaper
    - Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) + plasticizer
