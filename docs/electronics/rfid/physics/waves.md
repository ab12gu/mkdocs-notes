# Waves

A wave is a disturbance that propagates through a medium.

Water waves and sound waves are examples of mechanical waves, but light is not so easy to understand as a wave. Light waves are any waves in the electromagnetic spectrum.

## Radio Waves

Radiowaves are the light waves with the longest wavelength, so they have the least amount of energy in the spectrum. 

The frequency wavelength formula is given by

```markdown
            Œª = ùúà/f 
Wavelength(Œª) = Velocity(ùúà) / Frequency(f) 
              - Greek letters
                - nu:     ŒΩ
                - lambda: Œª
```

- where ùúà is the velocity of the waveform, if only the value of the frequency is given and the velocity is unknown, velocity of light in a vacuum is generally taken while calculating the wavelength of the wave. 

Speed of Light is ```3.00 x 10^8 m/s```

## Radio Wave Characteristics

#### Speed in medium

- Air is 99.97% of the speed of light.
- Coaxial cable or fiber optics are 30% to 70%, depending on the material.

#### Wavelength

- Range from a few millimeters to hundreds of hundreds of miles
- Visible light has wavelengths in the 400 to 700 nanometer range (1 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ m)
    - About 5,000 times shorter than the shortest wavelength radio waves.
- Radio waves oscillate at frequencies: 
    - few kilohertz to few terahertz (1 THz = 10^12 Hz)
