- The creators core is designed and intended for customization and highly-technical show integration. Based on the ESP32 platform with 32GB additional memory, a 9-axis IMU, riser-board breakout pads for accessories, an I2C bus with pads running the length of the board for easy hacking, and covered in 92 IR LEDs for video-motion tracking. We have not yet developed a good solution for 3D motion tracking, but it would be possible to add on your own components for that.
- Open source software and firmware for creators props is already highly development by an independent artist developer, Ben Kuperberg


Vision and capsule lights ("flowtoys connect”) : 
- 3-axis accelerometer, ARM M3 processor and flowtoys connect radio

Comparison:

  - Vision beta price: ~$190+/light core in a prop (club, 1/2 of a staff or pair of poi, etc.)
  - Creators beta price: ~$280+/light core in a prop (club, 1/2 of a staff or pair of poi, etc.)
  - Both vision and creators props have the same LED pixels, battery, body/build options, look and feel identical on the outside.
  - On the inside, creators core will have more processing, memory, sensors, wifi, bluetooth and available pads and pins for add-ons.
  - Creators props require technician/developer skills, and we offer very little technical support for this system.
    Creators’ WiFi radio requires advanced wifi routers and setup to be used in large numbers.
    Vision's “connect” radio can easily be connected and controlled in large numbers and remotely. A full-featured hardware remote control with DMX and MIDI input and more is in development.
    Creators can use open source software and firmware for creators props is in development by an independent artist developer, Ben Kuperberg. It is incredibly versatile, and some versions are fairly user friendly, but there is no “customer care” - you’re on your own at the whim of other experienced users/developers :)
    Vision props are affordable, simple and user-friendly with well-developed software, modes and support for casual users, artists and performers, who do not want to have to use a computer to control their props.
