# Electronics

This is a core set of my projects. I was first introduced to applying electrical engineering conecpts to real life at my undergraduate internship at [nVent](https://www.nvent.com/en-us/). 

It seems I run into a lot of electrical work in personal projects, repairs, and many robotics in both my work and high school teaching.

Generally, you don't need to make designs from scratch, but you can use [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) for free. I don't find the UI very well made and would prefer commerical software.
