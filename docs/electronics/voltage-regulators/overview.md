# Overview

# Buck Converters

DC-to-DC converter 

    - decreases voltage, while increasing current
    - Therefore very efficient
    - Has coils so causes interference with other electrical components

# Linear Voltage Regulators

LM7805

    - DC-to-DC converter
    - Drops any voltage to 5v
    - Releases excess voltage as heat (retains original current)
    - Highly inefficient
    - Unstable past 212F / 100C (automatically unpowers until cool)
    - Alternate versions for different current
    - < 50 cents
    - Most common integrated circuit in the world
