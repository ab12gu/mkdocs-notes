## History

09/29/24

- Installed a new controller, and chain, and the display
- Speed sensor and PAS does not work
- Throttle does and headlight and break sensors do
- Found visibily bent derailleur (replace later)

10/01/24

- PAS working fine w/ light action
- Computer response #3
- Identical controller has same throttle but no PAS
- Rewired and motor gave bad sounds but pas worked but not throttle
- pas and controller were both male? but colors red/black/yellow ere the same
  - Hypthoses is they swap connectors so wires can connect, should work
  - If not, cotnroller bad, or original wiring was correct
    - Then try other controllers labelled 'spares 1&2' and see if different results
    - May be worthwile to try 19amp controllers in back (waste of time assumed)
      - If nothign works, reinstall replacement #1 and diagnose the bike as perminately half functioning
