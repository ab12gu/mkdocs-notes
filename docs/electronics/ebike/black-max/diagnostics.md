- Name: Abhay Gupta
    - Throttle seems super powerful :)
    - Headlight seems to work (just hold up button)
    - Backlight is battery powered. The AA batteries are dead
- Solution:
    - Cadence Sensor wasn't sensing magnets
    - removed chain and ran pedals and the bike launched across the bedroom
