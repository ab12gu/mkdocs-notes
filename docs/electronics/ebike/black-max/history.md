# History

The shop notes of history of diagnostics before it was handed to me.

## 24/09/29

- Installed a new controller, and chain, and the display
- Speed sensor and PAS does not work
    - Theory PAS sensor cable connection problems or controller incompatibility
    - Test with another PAS sensor?
- Throttle does and headlight and break sensors do
- Found visibly bent derailleur (replace later)

## 24/10/01

- PAS working fine w/ light action
- Computer response #3
    - Removed first one w/ little throttle engagement and no speed sensing
- Identical controller (brand new) has same throttle but no PAS
- Rewired and motor gave bad sounds but pas worked but not throttle
- pas and controller were both male? but colors red/black/yellow ere the same
    - Hypothesis is they swap connectors so wires can connect, should work
    - If not, controller bad, or original wiring was correct
        - Then try other controllers labelled 'spares 1&2' and see if different results
        - May be worthwhile to try 19amp controllers in back (waste of time assumed)
            - If nothing works, reinstall replacement #1 and diagnose the bike as permanently half functioning
- Theory: If used 18 amp controllers from back, it should work
    - Notes say doubtful

## 24/10/15
  
  - Installed the controller that provides the throttle to wkr
  - Offered Velo Wave Prado S for $600

## 25/05/14

- Need to figure out right number of magnets for rear hub
  - and display to communicate to PAS
  - Need to pull the motor and count the magnets?
- Use for from XXL parts bike to bring this up to speed for sale 
- Now belongs to shop
