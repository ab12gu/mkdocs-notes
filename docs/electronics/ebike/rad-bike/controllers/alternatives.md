# Alternative Controllers

You can get a lot of controllers for a 10th of the price of branded controllers. The issue is that you would need to wire it yourself with crimps/soldering/etc that may take awhile to get right. 

Some ebike controllers are waterproof and have a keypad to use with it that isn't default with the off-the-shelf cheap generic controllers.
