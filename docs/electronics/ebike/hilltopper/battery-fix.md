# Battery Fix

I tried picking at the hanging metal in the charging port. However, it sparked and melted my screwdriver...

So I took off the bottom and it battery was stuck to walls of case...

So I tried sawing off the top... no luck

So...

I thought that maybe if I just biked with it in my waterbottle holder without a base, maybe the battery will just pop out!

And pop out it did indeed!

Otherwise, I was going to try out somethings:

1. Try buying a saw bit for my corded drill and cut off the sides
      - But the rpm might be to low to cut
2. Use a dremmel to cutt it (same bit)
      - Same issue... probably too slow of rpm
3. Then get the big guns out and cut it w/ an angle grinder
