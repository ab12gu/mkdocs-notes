# Overview

[Hilltopper](https://hilltopperbikes.com/2019/02/20/all-american-seattle-born-and-bred/) is a seattle based ebike manufacturer. 

Gabe used a ebike conversion kit to convert his [road bike](https://www.statebicycle.com/) to an ebike for his wife (at the time). 

It was working for awhile but he left it out and the charging port is shorted and would spark anytime you tried plugging in the charger.
