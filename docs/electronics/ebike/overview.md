# Overview

An electric bicycle has an integrated electric motor used to assist propulsion.

1. Throttle
    - throttle sends a signal to the motor controller to deliver power to the motor
    - thumb, push, or twist throttle options
    - Class 2 ebikes in the U.S. allow throttle up to 20 mph
2. Pedal assist
    - sensor detects your pedaling activity
        1. cadence sensor - detects if peddling (on/off) [feels jerky]
        2. torque sensor (high end) - detects strength of pedalling
    - motor controller delivers power to motor
