# Design

Need to connect it to a circuit and log the data of the output voltage via an app :). Then can decide if these prototypes work. 



## Prototype #1

1. [Hand Crank (dynamo) Cell Phone Charger, $3](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256811439121325.html?)
    - Take apart to get electrical components from it
    - This is the rectifier & voltage regulator to output ~5v (0-400mA)
2. Some 5v Battery bank 
3. Circuit to charge/output battery (i have it)


## Prototype #2

1. Extract only rectifier from dynamo (or build your own)
2. Add a supercapacitor(s)
    - Accepts low voltage & high current
3. Some output regular to ensure 5v (probably some mechanism in hand crank already)
4. Some 5v Battery Bank
5. Circuit to charge/output battery (i have it)
