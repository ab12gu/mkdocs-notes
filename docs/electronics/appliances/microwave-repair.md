# Microwave Repair

Microwave Model: `kitchenaid KMHS120ESS`


Problem statement: My uncle slams the microwave too hard and the switches that detect if the microwave is closed were pushed to far back pushing the coil spring out of position. 

Solution: Open microwave electronic controls and put the springs in place.

0. Turn off microwave (forgot)
1. Unbolt the top of microwave
2. Push up the buttonpad out of slots
3. Use a small screwdrive to help push the springs holding the switches to currect location

Issue: I didn't turn off microwave so I shorted the fuse because the screwdriver touched tow leads and caused a short, which pulls too much current into the load because there is no/too low of resistance. The high current trips the breaker in the breaker box.
