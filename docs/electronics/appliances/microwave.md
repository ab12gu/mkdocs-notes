# Microwave

Microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than other radio waves but longer than infrared waves.

- Frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz

# Electromagnetic Spectrum

The **electromagnetic (EM) spectrum** is the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation, ordered by **wavelength** or **frequency**.
