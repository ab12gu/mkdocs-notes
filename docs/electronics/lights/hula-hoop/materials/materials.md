# Materials

## PE (polyethylene)

- Most common plastic
- found for cheap at pacific hardware in cap hill
- generally used for irrigation lines found at Home Depot or Lowes
- used for beginner hula hoops
- generally solid black but not always
- material is connected by using barbed connectors

 The most common thicknesses for hoops: 

 - 3/4" 160psi (heaviest)
 - 3/4" 100psi (lighter) 
 - 1/2" 125psi (lightest)
 - the diameter refers to the inner diameter
   - the outer diameter is around 1/8" - 1/4" larger depending on the psi

## HDPE (high density polyethylene)

- rigid and lighter weight plastic than the standard PE
- experienced hoopers seem to prefer it to PE, though they aren't that different
- It is not available at stores
- Unlike PE the diameter refers to the outer diameter with this material
- 7/8" was a nice size for a big beginner hoop, and 3/4" is nice for smaller hoops
- connected by inserting a short piece of tubing that just perfectly fits inside it
  - pop-riveting it together

## Polypro (polypropylene)

- Second most common plastic
- lightest and most advanced material for hula hoops
- fast and springy, hard to learn on
- slightly harder and more heat-resistant


Attachment: 

- You will need tubing, a piece of tubing 1/8" smaller as insert material, a riveter, and two pop rivets. If you order tubing from hoopologie they will include insert material for you.

Decorating:

- 1/2" or 1" gaffer tape for grip
