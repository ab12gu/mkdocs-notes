# LED Diodes

Light Emitting Diodes

- semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it
- when current flows, electrons fill holes in semiconductor
- this causes the release of energy in form of photons

## Flow

- Long leg = Anode (+)
- Short leg = Cathode (−)
- Cathode -> Anode

## Voltages

| LED Color       | Typical Forward Voltage (Vf) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Red             | 1.8 – 2.2 V                  |
| Orange          | 2.0 – 2.2 V                  |
| Yellow          | 2.0 – 2.4 V                  |
| Green (standard)| 2.0 – 3.3 V                  |
| Blue            | 3.0 – 3.5 V                  |
| White           | 3.0 – 3.5 V                  |
| UV (ultraviolet)| 3.0 – 4.0 V                  |
