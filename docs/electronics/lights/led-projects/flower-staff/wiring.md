- Gold (too expensive) or aluminum

You can also do a copper wire with a gold/silver platting

| Material     | Conductivity (relative to copper = 100%) | Notes                                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Copper**   | 100%                                      | Most common; good balance of cost and conductivity |
| **Silver**   | 106%                                      | Best conductor, but expensive                      |
| **Aluminum** | ~61%                                      | Lightweight, cheaper, used in power lines          |
| **Gold**     | ~70%                                      | Resists corrosion; used in electronics             |
| **Steel**    | ~10%                                      | Strong but poor conductor; used when strength is more important than conductivity |
