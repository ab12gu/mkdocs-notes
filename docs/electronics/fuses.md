# Fuses

Generally when an appliance stops working, a fuse inside is blown or the circuit breaker of house is tripped.

Fuses are rated for 250V or 32v... But why voltage rating?

The lower voltage rating is for the container when fused. The container might melt if it is a higher voltage, but the wire will still be in contact under the current rating.
