# Voltmeter

There is a guy on ytb that says only buy a >$100 voltmeter. HE IS WRONG...

Those voltmeters are expensive (fluke brand) because they are used by the miliary and can charge whatever they want in order to keep consistency with the prior versions. 

Just buy the <$10 from Harbor Freight.
