# Alkaline Batteries

- reaction between zinc metal and manganese dioxide
- higher energy density and longer shelf life yet provide the same voltage than zinc-carbon batteries

## Chemistry

Zinc is oxidized:

- ```Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻```
- Anode (negative electrode): Zinc (Zn)

Manganese dioxide is reduced:

- ```MnO₂ + H₂O + e⁻ → MnOOH + OH⁻```
- Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) forms manganese oxyhydroxide
- Cathode (positive electrode): 

Electrolyte: Potassium hydroxide (KOH), an alkaline solution

- ```KOH → K⁺ + OH⁻```
- The K0H splits in water, and the potassium remains in solution
- OH- is also generated and restalked via the MnO₂ reaction

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Positive Terminal     |                                   |
| Manganese Dioxide     | Cathode - gain electrons          |
| Porous Separator      | Allows ion flow, no direct contact|
| Electrolyte           | Potassium hydroxide (KOH)         |
| Zinc Anode            | Anode - lose electrons            |
| Negative Terminal     |                                   |
